Video Title: IBA Nations League 2020 Round 02 Room 04

Transcript:
 further ado then it's a sports debate which should be excellent i'm very excited uh the motion this house is a fan of the club supports the takeover by the saudi uh public investment fund now invite the prime minister uh to begin the debate uh just on timing everyone please time yourselves i'll try and make hand just the appropriate times but we'll see how we go take it away prime minister uh hello am i audible sorry just once all right starting in three two one anyone who knows anything about football knows the club in question is newcastle and i'd like to point out as a as a just a point of note that manchester city suffered the exact same problem in some ways lack of funds did they were bought by saw the mrt and the access of funds ensured that he called battery players battery managers lots of better success all of which was beneficial for fans in two ways one they got to see their team that they care a lot about being more successful and getting more utility out of it but secondly due to that success and increasing fan base they got to access to cheaper tickets and cheaper merchandise one first thing i'm gonna talk about why what does the problem look like in its current state now actually the current owner right now is universally hated by newcastle fans you can see this in terms of how they've shattered him on social media how they've been protested against him and hate him a lot insofar as that guy has been responsible for the general downturn of newcastle in them being relegated even twice now what's the problem here one even though he's a billionaire himself he never invested on the club just in terms of well you don't have as much money capacity but also the incentive or the mentality of investing a lot so what that means you don't have as much payment to managers to players investment capacity later secondly he also doesn't have a lot of experience so perhaps at the other side doesn't have lots of experience that's quite symmetric as well as this guy's not this experienced manager uh owner of a football club but lastly we have seen trends of hiking up of prices why so because any owner even the owner right now has an incentive to have to let's say make money and so far you can't be successful and increase the base of the fans from which you get the money and you have a few fans left you have to hike up the prices for those two fans in so far as that's true right now you have the hyper prices of let's say football stadiums or tickets or merchandise which means that the fans are actually pissed off at him i would want to know this is literally what opposition has to defend because i am not too sure what other well offer or people are lining up to buy newcastle right now so this person who have has a lot of let's say like bad faith and bad bad image by fans is literally what you have to defend inspires fans are literally leading the club that's the side that officer looks like how do we fix it the first thing i want to talk about so two things here what incentives do football fans care about insofar as like they are the stakeholder it's an active debate so i think they want this team to be more successful to get more entertainment value value from that and also for things to be cheaper so first thing why do they get more successful this is pretty damn important as far as you're a football fan you watch the game for a particular competitive spirit you have rivalries you don't want your team to be relegated you want them to play higher up please you want them to be successful and so that you can enjoy matches no one wants to watch a team that's losing matches all the time right so why do we get a more successful newcastle and why do we win more matches so the first thing i think is crucial that we get better managers on our side of the house why so what do managers really want they want two things in supplies one they want to be successful they want to win stuff of that sort but largely they want like lots of money in terms of most managers go for large amounts of salaries because notice other clubs are way more rich than you are so even if you can't pay them lots of other people that are competing in the market can so they have that option of lots of more money to make because money is really useful for them or they can spend my money is also a symbol of how important they are that's how people in the campus were used to measure their work so it's kind of important the second thing they want to do is have their own strategic idea and strategic training plans this is drastically different across managers which is why whenever a new manager comes you need drastic changes to the infrastructure and the way the facilities you have that means you don't need a lot of money for that sort of investment in the first place but i think the managers are really really crucial and so far as we are useful and good managers they do everything regarding the team including hiring your coaching staff including design tactics substitutions team dynamics all of those types of things you have a better manager these can literally turn to teams and always buy it the saudi whatever boys would have an incentive to actually hire those managers but now they have the money to actually do so in the first place why is that because you have that money for the extra investment costs to actually pay the managers more and actually give them market competitive salaries which newcastle currently does not given that other clubs are too rich and too i'm just happy about these matches so you get better managers alongside and i've already told you why patrick managers lead to like coaching and stuff of that sort and ensure that you have a much better team there the second thing you get is you have lots of battery players again there are some players that are benefits or the amount of training or the experience they have far better than others and in front of football better players are a bunch of better players can drastically change the dynamics there are only 11 players that play at the end of it one good attacker can make a lot of difference insofar as that's true what do players swing on sure there are lots of factors we don't change all of them but one large factor is again money because again purchasing power but also the true value right you don't want to sign on to a club that's paying you less because that's seen as a demotion societal club that's paying you much more it's seen as a promotion even in terms of their rep their status and this is where they associate with themselves that's why manchester city will because i have lots of new players and so far they had more money to make that investment in the first place and surprise you have more money you can inside of these new players and because of all those reasons that's what mean that you have much better place playing for you and much more likely to be successful before i talk about infrastructure i'm willing to take a pi from closing if they have one all right just let me know then um yeah so regarding infrastructure why infrastructure really really crucial unique infrastructure and really like nice technologies and machines for training you also need to hire the best of the best healthcare experts and so on to ensure your players don't get injured they can actually play those 19 minutes they can play recurrent games in an extremely high pressure high intensity season the second last thing you need you need data unless and this is something that even i didn't know until involved for me but the point is lots of football unknowing to the average eyes actually depends a lot on data on strategy to analyze what team uses which strategy which player to actually hire which player to look at all of these things are extremely specialized fields by the way and cost lots of money in terms of computing power but also hiring the best of the best in suppliers there are lots of other people competing for them all of this means that by this investment i've shown you why it's worthwhile but you need the initial money to get you take investment in the first place if anyone is so so i've shown to you that you would be much more successful in so far as uh you actually win a lot and win lots more games i think that's a direct benefit insofar as you're winning games that means your fans are a lot happier that means they're going to celebrate more they feel more value and actually ensuring that they stick by you and they won't be like and competitive live with your friends and so on but also you get to play higher leagues and you don't get relegated so you get to enjoy and watching more games and better games than that i think that also means that the second benefit of cheapness also stands why so first right out of the bag and so fast you have more money you can actually take the hit to like not hike up prices as much to actually increase the fan base and give them cheap fans and maybe have a normalized price later on so that's the first thing but just in terms of the fact that you are playing better that means you can get more fans and suppliers fans are attracted to the club those clubs that are rising up the ranks that are the underdogs coming up and winning all these leagues are actually doing well in them and surprised that's true fans not only in the uk but all across the world like you to flock to you even more old fans who who left you new fans who are excited about your potential what that means and surprised there's more viewership you're likely to get one sponsors that means you don't have to charge the fans that much in stadiums because you're getting money from other mechanisms but you have more fans you have more fans that means there is more demand for your merchandise and inside that's true you can spread costs across lots of fans your stadiums are full and that's why you don't have to charge more per price so you get cheaper fan tickets but more on the single speech for all of this reasons so proud of us thank you very much for that speech we'll now have opening position up to begin the case off-bench here okay sorry just give me a sec to get my um get my timer up okay so i'm just going to talk about uh two things fairly straightforward things um first thing i'm going to talk about is what the fans care about second you want to talk about is what the sapphis the saudi arabia public investment fund care about why do things are radically at odds and why because of that as a fan you shouldn't support this um so firstly let's talk about what fans care about first observation i have is that this motion is not about fans which newcastle well this unnamed club used to happen it was successful neither is this motion about fans which the club could gain in the future he became successful it is about the core group of fans who despite this club's fall from glory still sticks with it through thick and thin what that suggests to us is that these fans are not engaged in like a crudely emotionally transactional relationship with the club right because there's a kind of fan who thinks i'm a fan of a club so that i can get pleasure of the club wins right it's almost like an investment model i invest my emotions and you give me happiness we suggest the fans who remain in this club are not that kind of fan rather they're probably fans who think that club forms a critical part of who they are as people in the particular region of the world from which that club comes so we're talking about newcastle we're really talking in this debate about people who have deep links to the northeast people who live in newcastle who care a lot about that identity and i know this is not just true of newcastle but just football clubs generally especially those which um have strong regional links or like go through difficult periods right so how do we think this regional identity manifests itself in terms of the priorities of these fans firstly they think it's critically important to them that the club contains at least some core group of players not completely who are from that region and who represent them the reason that is important is because you are not a fan of that club because it contains professionals who do well because these are people who are in some sense like you who might have walked the same streets you did right and in a very large part it's linked to regional identity because they're generational links as well right so people are fans of newcastle because their parents watched it when they were young because they get brought to a game and get hooked on the beautiful game because their grandparents talked about it over dinner because if you were from a struggling household it might actually be one of the few ways in which you gain pleasure in a way where it was difficult to get access to other kinds of entertainment so that's the first thing we can think about the second thing we think these fans care about and all of them this fortunately we care about is regional development i.e a club which actually plows money back into ensuring that people in that region just generally live better lives and specifically actually football so if we want to keep with this newcastle stuff right so newcastle owns a new council united foundation which specifically is about giving underprivileged kids in a northeastern region of better education it finds a huge number of after-school football programs which are critical for low-income families because just having a structured regime where you are disciplined where someone's taking care of you and your parents are working multiple jobs is actually critically important these local communities as well right similarly newcastle also has a youth wing and a women's wing they don't get very much attention but again newcastle fans really care about these things and we think these are general characteristics structurally of people who tend to stick with clubs that are not doing particularly well so why do we think therefore it's not in your interest for you to let this cooperation take over let's first look at what the sample is firstly it's not even a human being right it is an organization owned by the saudi arabian government whose explicit mandate is to do nothing but maximize revenue right its technical mandate is to engage in quote unquote strategic investment on behalf of the saudi royal family what that suggests to us we'll get to in a moment but the other thing i want to point out since this is saudi arabia that it's also likely that in part this investment is driven because some member of the saudi royal family thinks of this thing as his or her personal pet project right we think this is quite a logical thing to think because the saudi arabian royal family given its absolute hold of power and its obscene wealth it's not exactly known for being that careful about where it invests money and for engaging in lavish spending projects for their own personal proceeds what does this suggest to us they will do through this club and i think in large part this engages directly with what um the prime minister said firstly we think they're going to be profoundly unconcerned with maintaining a local core of players in that club or indeed getting rid of whatever identity he has so the current owner for instance mike ashley right who the prime minister mentioned um so it's true he does not have huge amounts of experience like directly playing football but he's been involved in the region for a fairly long time he grew up for there uh for some time he was quite prominent in the 1990s because he was actually one of the critical whistleblowers to revealing a scandal about price fixing of i think shirts to being zoned in the premier league right so these are people with some kind of time identity what we're going to have is that we're going to get rid of these people we're going to get rid of the call of local players who give that club that identity and who means so much to the people who are actually fans of this uh particular club are happy to take oh sorry this is yeah take a viewer from cj the bid exists on both sides of the house do you think that if the fence stops supporting is going to stop the purchase or the patches will go on either way um oh i'm not particularly sure but i mean my intuitive reaction is that this is not the debate about what the outcome is going to be it's more debate about what you as fans ought to do given your particular preferences um if it's going to happen either way uh then probably we marginally win because we make it marginally less likely that purchase will go ahead and the current fans might must be disenfranchised if the fans support it presumably that's just a lot easier you know um you know fans don't support it there's a lot of negative press coverage the daily mail might pick it up and say ooh look creepy nasty saudi arabians coming over and stealing our identity and that kind of thing is a fair amount of pressure um on saudi arabia want to come and take over so you know if it's going to go ahead anyway but rather we make a lot of noise and silently go along and see our club get destroyed for everything we care about so firstly we don't care about foreign keeping that core of things but um secondly we think also they stopped caring about regional development for the very simple reason that's not profitable and this is an organization taking over whose explicit mandate is to maximize profit why would you invest in after-school programs for local kids but none of those kids are ever going to start playing for your league and getting you those monetary returns in fact the club the owners are probably going to calculate that they can do all of these things if they manage if they manage to take over because once they take over they can try and gain a new fan base by you know um having a club do better right so at the end of the day we're willing to trade up the success of the club quite explicitly in order for maintaining that identity because we don't believe they engage in a transactional emotional relationship uh with this club what are you coming from opening government we just stole that well the first thing we see is well if you have better managers to perform well again we don't think it's what they care about the only relevance is that they say if you get more more sponsorship ticket prices no ah look if you're a club in one of the top leagues you will get money anyway right newcastle makes about 200 million pounds a year barely breaking a profit but still enough to keep going as it is still enough for those television rights to be shown in for people to want to watch it because even if people can buy tickets you can still watch these things on tv right even if you know the fact there's no point watching if this club no longer represents uh who you are right so at the end of the day this is a debate about trade-off between you know winning and maintaining a certain kind of identity and we think they'll still be bias at the end of the day because if you're if you're a club in the top leagues there'll be lots of rich people with pet projects want to take over but in large numbers people with links to the region and who are not creepy saudi arabian owned public investment corporations you could go to instead for all these reasons we're very proud to oppose that speech now welcome back to deputy prime minister taking the case for opening government just check am i audible they might buy kai hybrids uh in the future manchester city ferran torres liverpool bought left-back semicars and might be in the market for thiago manchester united well manchester united nobody needs to talk about manchester united newcastle united on the other hand bought this guy called mark gillespie from motherwell fc and this is going to be their third choice goalkeeper for the upcoming season and that a problem that newcastle fans face because before everything like even before regional development even before uh things like investing in the women's team or whatnot fans prioritize success because your city is going to be identified as a loser or a winner in britain depending on whether your club wins matches whether your club or your city gets like you know rights over manchester or liverpool it is is what fans ultimately care about so i'm going to challenge this guy about other stuff because i presume that lots of neutral actors who probably care about regional development care much more about like you know um you know the things that oh talked about but not necessarily fans but i'm also going to engage there the first thing i want to engage on is then regional development and i think over here side opening opposition completely completely misses the comparative because one of the reason why this core group of fans has been protesting against mike ashley for the past two years his book tripping now if you notice towards the end of uh hello they also talked about you know um the fact that 200 million uh was was generated and there isn't a lot of profit being gained out of it that's the exact reason why asset stripping is happening if you don't have profit you don't invest in in these sorts of local local players and local facilities so what has mike actually done mike ashley has ensured that the newcastle academy which used to be one of the best academies in the world is now academy which does not produce players at all over the past 10 years only three to four players have been homegrown players who have come up from the academy so i think just in terms of academy i'm not sure why mike actually develops this academy much better given that mike as she does not want to invest in the academy to begin with but the second thing i want to point out for the reason for why the saudis go berserk and like people from the city will still end up playing is because of two things one the premier league has this rule that you need at least a certain number of homegrown players for you to actually be able to buy uh foreign players the reason why tottenham for instance just bought joe hart is because they need a new spot to buy a foreign player who they could not have bought before so there is still an incentive for them to build local players and better players the second thing i would want to note is that there are financial fair play regulations that fifa and uefa do uh enforce that that's why manchester city for instance was hit with them in the past which means that you can't just go up spending like millions and millions of player of money on players you must actually develop your academies as well it's a side-by-side process but yes money still gives you an advantage so i'm not sure that the facilities or the training facilities will go to i'm actually pretty sure that they will be much better because there's an incentive to get home-grown talent at the very least the best home run talent because even if they don't play for your team you can actually sell them to other clubs and get transfer fees in the millions and and the end the training facilities that you create will be used by youth players but they will also be used by your players and you presumably need good facilities for your players as well so i just think in terms of like team development that's there the second bit about like you know investing in youth uh women's leagues foundation etc i would note that one there is no comparative reason for why mike actually as a billionaire cares more about this sort of regional development than the saudis do like just because this is an organization and that is a person i'm not sure why this is something that's done better on their end but i i would not the second thing one of the major criticisms of the saudi takeover has been the fact that there are immense human rights abuses being conducted in saudi arabia are being conducted by saudi arabia and the international community if anything saudi arabia has an incentive to pour more money into this foundation so it is able to whitewash uh its image and is able to duplicate like lots of the kind of criticism that have come its way the reason why this is important is because the kinds of impacts that opening opposition wants such as getting more money into the foundation so that school kids can play football or whatever is much better channel on our side of the house the second thing i would note is the only point at which you increase funding for foundations or non-profit profitable things is if you have greater revenue to begin with mike ashley is not running greater revenue therefore his ability to invest in the foundation is lower the second thing that i would also note is that the foundation isn't entirely run on money that ownership gives the foundation largely is also run on lots of donations that players uh players give or fans give or people from around the world so i'm not sure why this is something that wins the debate now coming back to the major focus of this debate which is why do we get more success on our side the house and buyers are also translate into cheaper tickets and so on and so forth now notice newcastle is barely breaking a profit right now and you need to ask yourself what is the reason that newcastle isn't making lots of profits i think the first thing you need to note is newcastle has been unable to expand its fan base therefore lots of people who are fans of newcastle come from newcastle there is no pakistani fan for newcastle like there's a liverpool fan in pakistan or liverpool like manchester united for instance has a global fan base the reason why this is important is if you have more people who are buying into say your merchandise or say sponsors are more attracted by you having a larger fan base the reason why this is important is if you have more profits coming from more sources you don't need to extract the revenue you absolutely need from a limited number of people that is why you don't rip off newcastle fans who come to the stadium buy a ticket which is extremely expensive you are able to subsidize a lot of these costs and are able to give people access to the club before moving on anything from closing nothing uh i go towards success then why do we get better success and why is that important because note for you to be able to build a global fan base you will need a bet i'm sorry out of time you will need a better manager because that manager will be able to buy attract better players buy better players make better tactics and therefore be able to you know fend off liverpool chelsea arsenal tottenham everybody i think that's the first thing and then you also get get the ability to you know pay back band just better but the second thing is you get players better and i think this part of essence analysis has not been tackled at all right players are concerned with two things one they want to win trophies they don't want to lose their career they only have 10 years they want to win something as opposed to being being in a team which is mid table or at least has been relocated in the past few years to a lower uh lower championship level right so you get better players on our side of the house therefore your ability to win crucial matches is much better but lastly you get better infrastructure on our side of the house for you to be able to get the best tactics the best football you need the best training page you need the best physicians you need you need the best like facilities for your players but you also need the best data analytics team currently because of so much competition the football market lots of these sorts of people and personnel are going towards other clubs you need to be able to attract them to one make other clubs weaker but your club stronger and this all this matters because success gets through revenues success makes the fans happy and more fast means cheaper costs in the future and also by the way means more funding for the foundation it means um it also means more funding for people who from seriously speech full disclosure you cut out there at the end it was already at 7 20 so we couldn't listen anyway uh if you just give me one moment we call it the next speaker i just need to go and get my laptop charger i'm about to run out of battery be back in one moment all right we're all plugged in so let's now have a depth of just knitter up to include the top here hello can you hear me hi let me just find my timer so i just want to start by saying that a bulk of the analysis that deals primarily with this mike hd fellow is actually irrelevant to this debate to the extent to which the motion doesn't specify a particular theme that this debate is about but rather calls upon us to talk about why exactly as a team within a particular league that there are sports for instance when faced with a choice about whether or not as fans we ought to support the notion of saudi arabia specifically using its investment fund to buy over our club that we care about deeply whether we should support it or not to the end i think that's a very simple question we just need to ask in this debate whether or not we think saudi arabia is more likely to be attenuated to the goals that the fans of the club are likely to have versus our own local owners and our regional ownership of that particular club let's look for the club and its fans first and what they care about so what opening government tells us is that fans care primarily about winning and seeing their club play more games and doing very well the first thing to note about this is that even if all of the analysis is true which i don't think it is the point of the matter is it really questions whether or not allegiances to a club come about from just the ability of that club they just happen to hold the name of your city or hold the name of the club that you use to support winning it a league or a tournament or whether it matters that that club actually represents the values of what it is that you originally supported so for instance arsenal well not arsenal any longer but like manchester united etc are all clubs that have global fan bases and these global fans presumably only give a about whether or not they win because they have no personal allegiances to these clubs but if you look at how for example leicester city was able to pull off an unlikely victory at the end of the day those are the kinds of wins that matter significantly more to the individuals who exist in leicester which was why the streets were flooded with people who were celebrating at the end of the day because they didn't rely upon money but rather actually cared about the successes of those teams as well which means that a lot of the analysis in the og also premises itself upon the fact that there is no ability whatsoever for these clubs to ever gain success which we think is just false but secondly what exactly do cat the fans really care about i would argue that as we said earlier fans don't just care about winning but secondarily i think what's more important to fans right now is that often these clubs represent especially more poverty-stricken areas which is presumably the reason that o.g rests upon us why these clubs are not doing particularly well they care significantly about how that club is a necessary and inherent part of their regional identity of the city or like the place that they are from which therefore suggests that to these people the idea that you can dilute their stakes and holdings in this particular uh club for instance and allow for someone else to take over in order for them to make decisions and therefore take away investment from your region it's something that significantly worse all for these friends than the counterfeit pro why is that likely to be the case let's first deal with the notion of enjoying the sport because they tell us that with more money we can get cheaper tickets we can get like better merch or whatever the point of the method is however that's actually wrong in the sense that when you have a bigger fan base there are more global you also attract like more money into that particular spot which is the reason why for example much for like very popular clubs are sky high because of increased demand around the world which therefore means that if you are a local fan that has cared about the sport for a very long time you actually then become priced out of being able to afford tickets to your local games you then become priced out of being able to support your local merch as well so i think the analysis is backwards but secondly what exactly are the incentives of saudi arabia vis-a-vis a local owner they say to us saudi arabia is now embroiled in human rights abusers therefore these human rights abuses are going to make them much nicer like first of all like just intuitively in what world has solid ever acted that way but secondly presumably we suggest that there's also like not a great thing to have when it comes to like saudi investment funds and allowing for them to use your sporting club as a means of diverting attention away from your human rights abusers as a fan of the sport which you've characterized with you is often a fan that comes in the region has been a lifelong die-hard fan for whom this has significant sentimental value too you don't really want your football club to become a play thing that allows for saudi the saudi arabian investment fund to be able to use it to disguise itself from the human rights abuses of like mbs for instance so i think all of those things make no sense whatsoever um the third thing then is this argument that uh that they argue about how we are going to be able to win or like be able to stay all in the league uh the first thing to note is that i don't think they were working in a situation of zero alternatives in the sense that even if the pif is the best possible alternative at the moment this doesn't mean that the club has no other ability to garner social funding so first of all you still have television castings etc merchandise there's still a local base level support of individuals for instance but also we suggest that there are other buyers that care presumably about the regional aspect and quality of your club they are also lining up to invest money perhaps not as much as the saudi arabian pif might but invest like via quantum and numbers money that is able to keep your club growing and continue to feed back into the kind of regional development and infrastructure that is necessary for you we think that it's better that this money goes towards your own community development as opposed to a saudi arabian investment fund that is far more likely to buy the big players for instance but also at the same time not cut off all of the losses that they would otherwise have by having to develop your own regional area and that's important because regardless of what the og says the comparative is quite clear in this debate in that the comparative means that there is more there is less likelihood that a person that comes to your club that is amenable to the pressures of your own local fan base and your own local individuals for instance is going to uh donate less to these regional developments and schools et cetera then they're the saudi arabian pif itself okay i'll take one from cg is nandanuchi anyone no all right so uh your analysis ignores the extremely comparative nature of football due to a variety of reasons thus fans care a lot about willing because that's linked to their culture applied pride of their local town and all of those sorts of things this is why you have strong football rivalries yeah you have strong football rivalries because i see the club as a part of my identity at the point at which like that club is not owned by saudi arabia like that one reason is there for me to care about that even though we both come from the same region of england like it doesn't matter any longer to me right but also this presumption that fans only care about winning presumably talks about a global fan base there's no allegiances to the region that that club is from in a club that hasn't been doing very well historically those fans don't exist we don't really care about them next thing then what exactly can sense assert in response to this idea of like saudi arabia coming in first of all many fans currently especially when you have a small fan base actually have sticks in that club which means that they are able to pressure their owners for example do not allow for their investment to come in so you think there's one strong mechanism as to why we can block this particular deal from happening in the counter factor you dilute your state and ability to control what the club does everything is significantly worse but secondly to the extent to which you have those strong regional allegiances to that club we think that you have a disproportionate ability to gather immediate attention and coverage over this particular situation that is then able to wash out any possible about this club at the end of the day this is what is important sporting clubs are incredibly important to people when they are the only thing that these people have it's important that we recognize that even if they're not doing well it's important to keep their original character as opposed to putting our hopes on saudi arabia to do it for us we're very happy to of course thank you very much for that speech and thinking we're on the top half and now we're going to the closing half and welcome the government member can you hear me okay three things an extension first of all what are the saudi interests why we think that this is actually in line with the interest of the fans secondly why we don't think that the identity of the team of the team is going to change it to an extent that it's going to harm the fans and thirdly why actually being in opposition as the fans is something that is going to harm them much more in the day after so even if you don't accept that things are going to get better things are going to get worse once they show that they are against this and this move would happen so let's start with the interest of the saudis so first of all notice that lester is actually quite a great example for our side because they have a very rich owner that is the owner of a duty free in thailand and he didn't change the team a lot because he knew that there is a process they started really from the bottom so what he did is give money and he told professionals to do what they did and here the professionals said okay we have good talent we still don't have enough credit in order to get people from real madrid because they are also owned by qataris and also very other rich people and then they became a wonderful team so we don't think that we're getting this this contrast that they are talking about secondly they assume that in status quo the uh the fans are the owners which doesn't exist in all teams except for one which is barcelona which is not the team that we're talking about so it's not as if the current fans have such a huge ability to change the cloud dramatically and then they are not being comparative to the actual owners that we are talking about that might have also diverse incentives because notice that the bulk of their analysis is they want to make money notice that anyone who buys a team wants to make money out of the team the only question is then are the saudis better than them and this is what we're going to show and why is that so we say that the reasons that the saudis are buying those teams is not necessarily to make an immediate profit because as we heard from already ashish they do lavish purchasing right this means that besides making profit which they could have by by buying oil companies and real estate and so on or other things in the west they want the lavish they want to be seen as this is a kind of new horse trading but now you have people running after a ball instead of a fancy horse that you buy they want th the luxury of being able to say we have a wonderful team now notice here that they are also going against the qataris and the emirates which are the regional enemies meaning that they want to have a wonderful team that is going to do well and is going to be unique not just any other team owned by the arabs by the western perception they want it to be something that everyone is going to talk about now notice here that this means that they want the team to do be to do really well but notice that this actually means doing things like developing the youth why because this is the kind of thing that allows you to have very cheap players that go straight into your club that you don't need to purchase from the outside or depend on anyone else or you can sell them at a very high cost that's why clubs like ix are doing so well and have a large a large youth base moreover we say that because on the one hand they want to be lavish and successful but on the other they are seen as the foreigners there are also a lot of pressures on them coming from the management that they are going to hire to do the best other players that are also local that want the the club to actually meet those values and also the fans and notice here that the saudis don't want to be constantly booed and don't want to be seen as the minis that are now doing other bad things not only in yemen but also in football meaning that they want to be to actually whitewash them to actually be seen as doing the best on all fronts so this means both the money and the investment in the team and not doing things that contradict what the uh what the original fans want but then why do we think that this also means maintaining the identity so first of all notice that we get this weak characterization coming from up saying if you have fans from all over the world you change your nature why that seems weird a that a lot of people from everywhere are going to come to this one team to newcastle there are so many teams that are winning that are doing even better than this team that is let's be realistic not going to win for at least five more years until things dramatically change in the infrastructure of the club so why leave real madrid why leave barcelona why leave other teams i don't understand it seems to me like people are going to like this team if they are kids watching it for the first time and if they are friends of the local base now moreover than that even if there is a new new fence you still have the identity because sport is all about narrative and narratives don't change because they are based on your rivals and on your region and on your position so if you are the proletariat team notice that this is not going to change because you have money because you still have the team of the more posh people within london and they're not going to say to you ah now you have a fancier accent no they're still going to look down at you and to say ah you are the team of the proliterate meaning that these things still exist and the nature is preserved by the fact that other people view this narrative of you moreover you sit there with other people liking you so for example in paris saint-germain there's a lot of money and yet the fans are local and you have jews and you have people that are immigrants and all of them are sitting together and this didn't change because the ethos is this is my team this is my identity and notice that no one leaves the team even when things are going poorly so why would they leave the team if the owner is someone that they don't like they are seen as wussies and this goes even against their machoism before i continue oh yeah so maybe saudi arabia will pretend to do all these nice socially responsible things to get ownership but once it has ownership and can legally do whatever it wants what incentive does it have if it's just waging proxy war against other arab states to actually develop regions so ashish i i analyzed that a ton i think hidal would answer more but notice that if then the fans are in opposition they're still going to be the purchase because exactly like oao says the saudi arabians manipulate the media and they get more coverage and if they want that team and that is the team for sale that they're going to buy it but then this means that the fans are seen as a problem the fans are seen as something that the owners don't really want exactly because of what we analyzed and this means that they would much go against them they would change the price of uh of tickets in order to block them out they would paint them as hooligans in the media they would make sure that that they don't get the privileges that they do and we think they would buy players that go against their identity and not just people not from their identity and this is going to be way worse for the fans because they would lose everything so for all of those reasons we call you to propose thank you very much for that speech we'll now have the gov i'll show you the opposition number up to begin the co case can you hear me yeah yeah yeah people in the chat around 5 45. or something cool all gives you some reasons why this how to say this football club is very important to yourself identity where they miss the point is how intense it actually is in terms of that your beliefs and values you hold about yourself and when something is part of your identity this is something that you ascribe to a club especially if you're a hardcore fan in this sort of situation which means that you look at the club as a moral actor as somebody who's representing your own sense of self and your own beliefs and core values this is important because this is usually crucially connected with first of all your local identity how you feel about where you grew up your city your town second of all political identity beliefs that you hold that your family holds and that your club stands for third of all generational heritage what would your father think of this or what would your grandfather your fathers before them think of this move in a sense this is a baggage that you have when you're making a decision whether this is something good internally or not but also you're not necessarily choosing who you root for this is quite like religion in terms of something that is being indoctrinated by generational thing by you wanting to hang out with your father and watch the football game and connect and wonder these are situation this is important but different bit of a different level also from opening your position it's important because you want your identity to be affirmed by yourself but you also want others to acknowledge your identity as something that is positive as something that is good this is going to be lost here and this is going to be our extension why other fans who actually value opinion off are going to be horrible towards you and this is going to diminish any success that you can have in this sort of situation let's talk about framing necessarily because we will take governments at their best like i will mitigate it but like even in our case works even if you start to win right your happiness and perception of success is always based on expectation and relative term so in so far that you have to say have uh have you seen even if you have a small win against somebody if you expected your team to be the last on the table this is something that brings you happiness as a team even if you're going zero zero versus a favor this is this unbelievable story right in this registration you feel much better if the expectations rise if you at least have more money like that you compromise your value is fine but like we will win i guess every loss that you now are going to perceive is going to be much higher in the association and even monica consists to some extent that this club is not necessarily immediately going to become successful but let me give you structural reasons for this right team cohesion you cannot just buy 11 new players 25 so much one and then they will magically fit together into all of these things so even throwing money at the problem is not necessarily solving the problem manchester city for 10 years of arab money that is coming into them they want two titles in total and they lost the majority of the situations the majority of other policy very important things the problem is also failures like you can decide on a bad transfer somebody was good one season and then they were good bad on the other season but also this is not even the largest amount of investment the club has gotten real madrid manchester city barcelona will have even much more money than this so even if so far that money is at stake the comparative is still let me see the younger clubs also have a larger shipment of money that you're also competing with so the success is not guaranteed but the expectation is raised and this is a crucial problem because down now that you say have this expectation of money being something that will bring you success every loss hurts 10 times more because this is an embarrassment you sold out you sold yourself and you sold yourself for nothing because you didn't win that title so minutes of courage wins sometimes the dwelling on losses is something that is going to be much more crucial let's talk about the most important thing this is the perception right usually the fans and football club football pens are usually having like a very internal community between themselves different people rooting for different things you're necessarily distincting yourself against the other fans in terms of their identity their political beliefs how their club is conducting that we are the club about this and the important thing is that this identity is already formed you're necessarily changing this identity very important for other clubs and how other clubs and other clubs fans are perceiving your club to begin with right currently in the state of school they're perceiving somebody who has like a very vulnerable old heritage like like they will they will remember i look at you all the whole days that that's club not to mess with in the association with this the the perception and the thing that will happen especially intentions why does this essentially exist right like when you're at the stadium when you're clubbing the game your other club's identity is also threatened you have the urge to attack to banter banter is the most important thing chanting on stadiums even escalating into fighting and huge problems that existed in this situation because how they say this is a huge part of the internet being perceived as selling out in the association to towards this is something that is very horrible like look at manchester city manchester city's nickname now is arab money club in this association this is not something that will bring you pride this is something that brings you shame and this is something that other clubs in other clubs fans are necessarily going to exploit in the narrative because they know it pisses you off but notice that saudi money is even more pernicious even more than emirates right saudi arabia has been declining over the years in terms of their popularity in terms of how people are scrutinizing them notice the incident and how it shook the world when they literally butchered the  journalists this is what you're associated with like oppressing women yemen bombing all of these people are starving children fossil fuel industry in terms of climate change all of these things mean that like when noah neon neo project that is now trying to sponsor many leagues in the world tennis will speak of legends majority of these cards usually usually ends up by fans huge backlash and then they're having to pull this this how they say sponsorship for that reason this is what happened with league of legends when defense were just pissed that your league is associated with something like this this is likely to happen on this side of the house especially because other teams have been incentive to harvest also taking pictures right mbs being in the stadium taking pictures with your players and all these things having saudi arabia flags one of these things is deeply hurtful to yours your case open government please yeah the investing firm does not have an incentive to change the identity of the club because you need to backlash from the original fans which are the most important ones sorry but it's going to be perceived that you change the event that you're associated with this is not necessary they're going to change the name of the flag it doesn't have to be that bad it's just that the other teams have the incentive to push you for it but also even if so far look at when you win in this sort of situation people don't see this win as something that is dramatic and it's very cool when you have somebody who wins against all odds you respect them for it and all of these things if you win with uh like huge money nobody respects it even in football community they're just saying hi you only won because you had this money this is why most of these clubs are usually seen as villains right they're poaching other players you'll notice this also they're poaching players from your club and bring them into your own club with arab money this brings even more antagonism towards them under their side of the house which means that even if insofar as you succeed nobody acknowledges that success nobody says bravo you're the best god they actually say yeah you only succeeded because you sold out towards this money so even your winnings in the association are much much worse on their side of the house so so they perceive you as the enemy this is the most important comparison because it doesn't have to do with any incentives it just has to do with the foreign identity and how important it is towards these people and that interaction in the group where they're most likely to care about this is why you should vote closing opposition thank you you rush that speech will have the government from good to go bench one second this is after all a nation's tournament and what says an ancient tournament more than a shutterstock image uh can you hear me great so one second three two one go we think that a lot of what co says is actually based on the premise that the identity of the club is being hurt by this motion this is at best very reliant on all those cases why this identity is actually changing we still didn't do a lot to extend on but at worst and actually in reality just embarrassing because mirosh can't do that when he doesn't respond to monika's analysis on why actually the identity is going to be preserved and the entity is going to be actually preserved in a much better way than the alternative and therefore all of the things that comes from the identity changing are actually not happening i'm going to talk about two main things in my speech first of all what are the likely things that saudi arabia are going to do and how it interacts with the interests of the fans of the club and secondly how specifically supporting or not supporting the buy is going to affect the action and why do you think that supporting is the right thing to do if you want all of the interests of the club before that a few points of extraordinary buttons so first of all i just want to know do you to notice that ceo didn't respond at all to any of our points this is extremely important because we would love to engage with them but they didn't engage with us so we don't know what do they think on our case they probably agree which is great second of all they tell us that now the losses are going to be more painful therefore it's going to harm all of the facts first of all we don't think that we don't think this we think that this is kind of intentional with oh oh claims that winning is not an important thing for most fans they mostly care about regional development they mostly care about this being connected to the area about historical relations therefore we don't know why losing or winning is very important in ceo's mind if all claims the opposite secondly we think that specifically in the scenario that we talked about in this motion probably the fans are already used to lose a lot probably they are losing most of their games they are probably going to win more games than before and therefore when they look at the league as a whole they're going to feel that last year they're in the 11th place and now they're in the fifth place maybe it's not first but they will think that they are better which is probably the right scenario secondly thirdly on that we think that probably they are just symbolic things that are going to let them think that the club is going to a better direction first of all like probably some people are not going to leave the club because they are being bought by other clubs which is like a huge demoralizing effect for those people secondly they are going to get like a nicer stadium a nicer manager or of those stuff that is going to make them feel better we don't think that like all of those things are overriding all of those good things third of all they tell us that your identity is now linked to specifically bad stuff like saudi arabia and therefore it's going to create more violence and stuff like that so first of all we don't think that your identity is connected to that we don't see that we don't think that today all chelsea fans are being connected to roman abramovich or something don't think this is what people think when they think about football secondly we don't think that this mo this is comparative probably everyone who buys a food club is a billionaire probably every one of them is doing something bad if it's frauding people if it's being in oil businesses if it's all of the stuff that created the crisis in the economy or something like that we don't think this thing is comparative at all and it starts like a binary thing either you're good or bad in the analysis of co so they can't like rebuild it on why specifically saudi arabia is more bad because they just said that you are going to be linked to bad stuff in general but thirdly we think that this also ignores monika's analysis online actually there are going to be more violence and more bad interactions when you are specifically doing things against the owners of the club because now in saudi arabia is going to be the owner it's going to take more of your special rights to like buy the best tickets and stuff which means probably the fans are going to act more violently and worse during those things which is going to make and how the view to be seen even worse which we think is what ceo wants to claim his meaning but we don't know how it really the link that means debate anyway let's move on to our points what is saudi arabia likely to do so og gives us a brilliant analysis on why it's going to help the club wins and making the club wins is the most important thing all we've said two things which we think are quite reasonable first of all winning is not the most important thing because for many of those people there are things that are more important otherwise they would just probably uh move to like be a fan of another club or something like that and secondly they completely agree that saudi arabia will want to make this club win which means that all of og's analysis is at best evil event to what the clash in this motion is but what did obao tell us first of all they've told us that it's going to that those new owners are going to only be about the money completely ignoring the their incentives of the fans but there is no action analysis on why those things happen so let's actually rebut those points to show you why monica means wins over them first of all we think that all just assumes that regional development is an important thing we think that even if you don't care about winning specifically you care about the fact that it's related to your culture to the history of your family all of those things are not directly connected to regional development and you don't think that the way of showing specifically this mechanism is the most important aspects in any friend's life second of all we've told you that actually regional development is the thing that they are likely to do because it is cheaper to create good teams if you are spending money your time when you are young you can actually sell them to other places which means that even like the best case of ooo still happens more on our side but why did we tell you more than that oh i told you that they only care about money we think that first of all those things are not comparative every owner probably cares about money what is comparative in this debate if you spend 95 percent of your money on your club you probably care on the money or on making money much more because all of your money is spent there probably care less about making money when it's only a slight percentage of your money so we think that comparative probably the saudis care less about making money than that also we've told you that probably the saudis do this not because of money but because they want to project that they have like a cosmopolitan identity in all of those stuff before i move on i will take oh yes right so your analysis relies upon the idea that the only thing that the public investment fund of saudi arabia cares about now is weaponizing this football club to like a switch which is how you get all the benefits but given that no no thank you thank you we don't think that our analysis is lies on our premise we've analyzed why it is true so it's not a premise but also analysis also works in the other way because even if they only care about money we've told you that the best way to make new friends is to make your fanbase bigger and the best way to get your fence is not to have a bad media coverage of all of your fans are handing you so probably they are going to involve the fans in their decision probably they will want to create the fans to like them to tell about their friends that good things are happening and gets more friends so all of the things to actually pleasure your fans are happening even if they only care about money but then let's make the comparison within those things because even if we just show you that it is good but even if you don't buy it at all we think that even who always told us that in the vast majority of cases probably the buy will go either way what does that mean that means that the way of slightly slowly growing your fence is not going to work if your fence does not support you and hate you from the get-go the only way to grow in that sense is to do different things that are going to create new friends which means taking away the rights of many of the fans that do right now not having the regional development not having their best interests because you are completely changing this happens much more when you are against the body that when you support the guy it actually works with them to create a better club from all of those reasons please support the motion thank you if you watch that speech when i have the op whip up to conclude the debate here okay uh can you hear me rob yeah so well okay uh three two one go what we tell you all o tells you this is really important to people's identity what milos tells you the beginning of the speech completely disregarded by them is that when you see something that's so important part of your identity you view that institution as independent moral actor in itself when nazis invaded serbia my great-grandparent wouldn't want serbian orthodox church to be involved and to collaborate with the nazis even if that would save many lives even if that would help churches not being brought down even if it was enhanced interest of our nation and of believers of serbian orthodox church but because my great grandpa view my church as a moral actor and with that regard as an extension okay of himself and how he perceives morality because it is so important part of who he is as a person this church is what he is as well as newcastle is what newcastle fans are this is how you view this on us not proving as cg claims that this is somehow going to harm your identity because the club is going to work in the interests of defense we agree okay club is going to be lavish things invest loads of money save the players whatever it doesn't really matter what matter what matters is that the identity of my club is going to be stained with what milos tells you in his speech that either disregards and doesn't hear us say which is you will be associated with jamal khashoggi's body being decimated in the embassy in istanbul with hundreds of thousands of children in yemen dying of uh dying of malnutrition with fossil fuel industry that is destroying our planet and will kill it for generations to come and as the country that has worst image in the world you know how people look at saudi arabia they view it as if some bunch of people in the desert found uh found black gold and then associated themselves with most extreme branch of islam and created one of the richer states in the world because of that this is what my identity is being linked with so i as a believer of serbian orthodox church would never want money from saudi arabia even if this would enhance interest of my church and even though we will build many more churches get more believers get people to like us i don't want to be associated with that specifically evil agent we're speaking about one of the most evil agents that exists in the world today very distinct from other billionaires like like roman abramovich or thai retailers whoever is the owner of the other club i forgot saudi arabia has very distinct population especially in the environment where you have anti-muslim narratives all across uh uh all across europe so even if they do everything in the interest of the fans and they want to preserve that identity the very fact that you have been stained by that evil evil money is going to uh is going to you know haunt you till the rest uh is going is going to hold haunt you until the rest of the living days that being said we give you two distinct new impacts that weren't existed in all over the twins this debate one is what brings you happiness happiness is about expectations as milos tells you no refuse no response by ido what does this mean hi in serbia if i study law i want to work in a law firm that's going to pay me 2 000 a month in next five years and to do some relatively interesting cases whereas if you're a lawyer in new york who went to eaton and then harvard you want to work at the top law firm in the world so this guy from eton is going to be much more sad than i am if he makes still triple the money that i do and in a much more fancy company because his expectations are much higher than mine this is why this year and this is crucial comparative this year real madrid fans were some of the saddest fans in the world because they finished second in the link okay and they lost in the quarters of champions league even though they were among top 10 most successful clubs in the world their fans are much more sad than fans from albacete who took one win over barcelona in copa del rey and managed to win some interesting aids because expectations offense of abassette were much slower and this is how people in general psychologically look at happiness so when milo steve gives you reasons why in next 10 years and monica consists they're not going to get that successful every loss is million times more painful and every win is worth much less than it is now when we have some preservations uh when we have when we have some preservations about identity second thing that milos tells you when something is so important in your identity what is important is that other people around you reaffirm that identity that they like you they think that you are it was the right it was it was uh you represent something right and this is especially important regarding fans and their inner culture in your community as milos tells you for next 15 years and stadiums you're going to hear error money okay nobody offense wants to hear them this is where emotionally these people are getting struck with because everyone is going to make fun of them for the next 15 and 20 years and nobody's going to reaffirm that identity which is essential if something is really important part of yourself in fact it's going to be extremely negative connotation regarding that identity i'll take cg soon these are two very distinct these are two very distinct parts that are that are important regarding happiness cj do you have poi yes i would love even 20 of the population to know if saudi arabia is worse than qatar the americans or pronounce the murder journalist name but most people don't care and we've given you analysis to why the core part of the club's identity like being a coal miners town or something is not going to change for the worst and actually no no no first of all i think this is just a  everyone knows saudi arabia is one of the least popular countries in the world everyone know that kilis was all over the news okay it's a rebuttal that you are giving it's just factually incorrect but secondly it doesn't matter identity my friend is not what they do with physical stadium identity is what psychologically you think that your clubs represent and now it represents uh muhammad bill white washing his murderer's ass over buying a club that has already previous reputation i as a fan have no business in being associated with such evil deeds i agree they want a lavish and they want to show their family prestige this is exactly what i don't want to be associated with even at the cost of losing games with that being said cg really doesn't have any any benefit okay developing youth projects not comparative every analysis is whoever the owner is okay new fans i don't want new fans okay i i do you know why because when clubs have many good many good fans other fans associate that with band wagon fans so everyone is going to think that i'm not legit fan but when bag on pencil came in only because we have now uh because now we have uh now we have arab money with them uh next uh uh next thing that cg says oh but they're going to buy anyway so now if he has a club this associate we're going to have some harms notes that we and op don't say oh we publicly need to associate with them we just normatively oppose this acquisition by  sovereign fund okay so this argument is pretty so this this uh this argument is pretty much out of the debate then i say oh but it's going to be uh only about supporting the narrative yes exactly this is going to be only about supporting the narrative we tell you that you finding happiness okay through the narrative look at my emulation analysis what this narrative is going to look like it's going to be extremely damaging to preservations of the clock at the end of day we agree with almost everything that government says but we still win this debate because we show you how human psychology works and we show you how you and how humans in general perceive morality rarely have i been so proud to oppose thank you very much for the speech thank you for the debate remember to go across the floor and shake hands how do you virtual high five will have to suffice i invite all speakers to now please leave the breakout room don't leave the zoom just the breakout room and we'll call you back in about 15-20 minutes or so thank you everyone
