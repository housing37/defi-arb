Video Title: IBA Nations League 2020 Grand Finale

Transcript:
 time signals on the chat so just please be mindful of that so you won't be getting it from me please refer to the chat um if everyone's ready great um i'd like to welcome the prime minister to open the city can you hear me yeah realizing the chat around 5 45 i'll take one cool just one more second okay cool three two one this person motion requires a specific burden of more opening opposition and oppositions in general in this sort of situation what this motion says is that you shouldn't base your comedy around this in association so our burden is not to say that you should never talk about stereotypes never use slurs and they'll never use any of these things but you should not base your comedy all around the creative personality based on this is a very like nuanced courtesy burden that we have to defend so if they grabbed the wrong case i'm sorry guys you prep it wrongly but so for example bad example with amy schumer that making herself look like slop being like a slot and all of these things there it is like is it is what we but we regret but obviously you can talk about race and we actually encourage you want you to talk about race and your problems but we believe you're much more likely to be effective if you don't talk about it in this sarcastic manner let's talk about normalization in society and why this is horrible on our circumstances so necessarily this comedy is a complex form this is a comedy of sarcasm and parents usually when you're basing yourself around these stereotypes and slurs the problem is that usually it's a very subtle thing you it requires high iq to understand rick and morty but it also requires high q to understand a lot of these comedy coming from them for their sonos for a couple of reasons first of all if you're the ones who needs their minds changed you believe all of these stereotypes this sarcasm flies over your face because under these conditions this is your opinion you feel this is true you're like applauding it haha they're saying something that i agree with this cognitive bias is preventing you from second of all sarcasm is a complex concept in the association requires a lot of attention and comprehension from the listener to notice the subtlety of this terrible people are simplistic people are simplistic in any discourse with any joke and especially if the joke is not obvious in that matter which doesn't mean that we have to have obvious jokes that this has a pernicious negative potential on our shuttle cause and first of all sarcasm needs to be clear in order to be understood so even if they can give you a good example of let's say dave chappelle or something is doing this perfectly or well a lot of other comedians that are lower tier meet here or something list are also unlikely to come across is this being a very sarcastic portrayal the casing example is amy schumer which is really killed by the alt-right because they don't feel this is sarcasm they feel that she is doing this the problem is this normalizes how other people view you and how other people interact with you so in a sense where you're sitting with your friends and looking at this comedy this is how free your friends talk to this is what friends your friends believe that your community represents usually these people don't have nuance about how how they should engage with a minority uh minority background person but also how friends talk to you and that you talk about you but also how you perceive that your friends are looking at you in association and also how people talk to you on the internet which leads to a very pernicious discourse especially on the internet which is quite bad and quite hard for which i'm going to get to in one second but let's talk about why why especially from the part of the community a lot of people can't take a joke on their identity and their spirit type and they can laugh about it but a lot of people can't especially people who are the most decent franchise inside of them that community who have received the most of you who who have negative connotations of these slurs and in their faces the problem is that the problem is when you when you're evoking some of these you're evoking memories of this trauma and association and notice that the context is also important that they're going to say oh but this is laughing but that's especially the laughing context because you perceive this slap as these people laughing at you as well because you felt that this is a traumatic experience an association knows being in the audience most likely if you're with friends they're gonna look at you like hahaha this is similar to what you do or something like this or like watching clips with your friends similar to something like this the problem is you feel not that they're laughing at the problem but a lot of you feel that a lot of people are laughing at you and a lot of this community which feels that you feel much more alone less likely to speak up it definitely has a negative impact and hurts you in some ways rather than having a huge positive impact on deconstruction and obviously which we think is unlikely but also it means that this essentializes these comedians it means that they lose their voice when they talk about other things for a couple of reasons right like there is like this this limits the amount of things that you can do if you're basing your comments around the specific thing this is what people are expecting you to some extent to do like if you go to any school comedy you expect certain things that she will do also if you go to dave chappelle this means that this burden of expectations on these comedians means that they always do the same thing there are so many ways that you can parody uh can i say uh stereotypes in this conversation the problem is this also limits your uh plausibility when you talk about the issues that actually matter right if somebody essentializes you as a black person or as woman especially in the context of these stereotypes this means that your message coming and criticizing you becomes much less powerful on this one on this side of the house because they believe this is true but even if you don't feel this is something but for example there was a good example of a fan of amy schumer coming to her and saying the word to her and she said her saying like this is not okay this is not not all right and pushing him aside the problem is it sparked huge backlash on the internet because they were like oh but this is your comedy he was just playing along with your comedy this is like when stephen crowder ben shapiro milo yiannopoulos all use this to co-opt is not being persistent ah you want us to laugh and deconstruct but now when somebody coops this and wants to use it the nuance is lost and it's especially lost when the people who you actually don't need to change their opinions on the problem is on the flip side your powerful message about racism about how they say uh different very different uh other problems that your community is facing can be managed in a completely different package it can be certain you can talk about jokes about general stuff which people draws people to the show and then you can talk about problems like dave chappelle does to some extent which they should help manage to escape the stereotyping most of the comedians substantialized towards this narrative that is about closing opposition uh opening yeah sure so what's the point in having a wonderfully nuanced message about racism if no one books you as a comedian in the first place that's not the point right like do people look at communities because they're funny right these people are still funny in a sense it's just not funny in the same way for example if you're gonna say ah people like to listen to god i see people staring at yourself this is usually the audience that you're less likely to change their minds if they're coming from that specific reason if they're coming from agreement with you if you say the message is going to be what i say likely to despair it's definitely not but even somebody that is the problem is that you say in that sense uh the problem is in that sense it becomes less powerful it decentralizes you into the specific thing that you talked about you're a comedian that is basing your funniness on this go be funny and not talk about this political stuff why are you all of a sudden being political this is a more plausible message in rebuttal if they base their comedy on this the problem is and this is where our framing comes into play so far that sarcasm has some like this stereotypes have some impact right if you do them more sporadically if you don't base your comedy this also has higher impact right you're changing people's minds like if you're all like if people notice the same old story that you're saying this is not even shocking anymore so that we can also coop some of the benefits if it's the right place the right time in the right the right situation but not creasing chaining these comedians into being essentialized by their identity and necessarily and not being able to talk and speak about other things that are important to them that's why you should vote opening government thank you thank you we now welcome the leader of opposition sorry one second yep can you hear me cool the chappelle show and boondocks were pieces of comedy that weren't subtle they were based primarily of slurs and stereotypes about their culture but they didn't limit the comedians who made those things and they didn't make people more racist what they did was find a particularly effective medium to bring a discussion about the bits of these cultures that were like entertaining and interesting and worthy of discussion into light in a way that wouldn't have been done in other ways i want to tell you from opening opposition is that this kind of comedy is often well judged by the people who produce it and does a lot of good for getting discussion of important issues out into the public sphere and shining a light on some of the issues that these communities face i want to make a few points of clarification beforehand so opening government has this strange notion that like this comedy is subtle it's like requires a discerning eye i really understand i want you to think about like you know a show like fresh off the boat or the chapel i'll show you to have like 15 layers of analysis to understand why it is funny right like they point out the facets of a culture that and they use this as a starting point even though they're formed in stereotypes to discuss that culture as a whole but i think there are three important facets of this kind of commute comedy that are important first of all minority of people are often good at judging where the line is drawn and what things they would find personally offensive in the way they want to present their culture even when they're using stereotypes additionally to that there's a strong culture today of calling shows out when they cross that line should be there's lots of trash comedy out there it's probably should be that it's discerning it has some thought and consideration toward the line an appropriate way the second thing is that often this is a coordinated identity right and they're talking about in a way that is most like inaccessible to other people if we ask them to not use this we're often restricting a like most functional way of these people getting that discussion out there and the third kind of thing is that this is not necessarily lazy comedy right like using a stereotype or a slur is not equivalent to just being a chief racist that's already highlighted two pieces of rebuttal they're like suffocate sarcasm whatever this the second thing i want to point out is that these people will lose their voice like they'll lose the capacity to talk about further issues because they've been so like drawn into the sphere of being a like stereotypical comedian no like dave chappelle got to go on lots of shows right he got to change his comedy over time because lots of people found him funny we're looking at he got to go and talk about issues that he cared about often becoming a popular comedian through whatever mechanism you do so and bring those issues to light means people are more likely to listen to you in the future it gives you the scope to expand that comedy and the scope to discuss those sorts of issues so even if you thought that the first instance is comedy was bad it does not necessarily follow that we should a priori blank blanket like hate all of this kind of comedy insofar as empirically it has been pretty good at bringing comedians into life two pieces of substantive first of all better for interaction with majority cultures so opening government sort of core concern which i share in this debate is that we want to make sure that the issues of these minorities communities get brought to life and we discuss it in a productive and informative way i want to point out that often these majority communities are hostile to being criticized directly right they don't want to believe things like they are personally responsible to suffer well they want to cast blame and dispersion these sorts of things so direct comedy like comedy that says like you know here are the bad things that are being done let's make fun of white people for all of the strange they do it's not as well received as comedy that has its starting point a sort of like stereotype or a slur that's like welcoming and accepting the fact that maybe there are some funny things about my own culture as well because a it's not adversarial and be it's more relaxed they don't feel like they're coming there to be lectured they're coming there for some entertaining discussion of that stuff that more openness is a far better mechanism in a lot of circumstances the comedians are often well placed to judge at getting those sorts of ideas out there and engaging people with the sort of ideas you want to talk about like you want to talk about the experience of an african-american in the united states i think the boondocks got a lot more young white people to do it than any like black comedian who just put up and lectured people about how funny it is how like white people are really racist all the time right that has been a more accessible way of reaching the people who would not otherwise be read the important corollary of this is that often this gets you a platform that you would not be able to have you get booked in more places because you're famous and you have more platforms you use a sort of diverse range of comedy you might want to use you get exposure on the news and additionally you open up more scope for different comedians from your ethnic background right because now there is a successful figure from your background and you can use that leverage to get more of them this is important because the currency of comedy is sort of like exposure and people finding you funny and entertaining insofar as comedians are deciding this is what they want to do it's likely for good reasons and it's likely meaning they have a message to get out there the second thing i want to talk about inside this sphere is that it is important to own the sorts of things it is done i do not think that the opposite of comedians from these kinds of cultures making these jokes and basically stuff from the stereotype is that these do not exist and they get supplanted by like comedy that is falling of the like kosher nature that open government once think about for instance how many corners of the internet that like many young men and women read about that make all these terrible jokes not with like an eye to trying to make good social commentary or improving well but simply with an eye to like making racist jokes and like not just being like haha he's a funny thing about like you know world culture in australia just like here's the funny world boy doing strange stuff but i would posit it is better that like the movie the wolf boy existed then people simply made like silly slurs about people from that group on the internet in a way that was unlikely to lead to anything more productive so insofar as these sorts of slurs and stereotypes are going to be talked about in schools and people grow up it'd rather the comedians own that spirit and we're able to morph it into something productive rather than leaving that as solely the ambit of people who don't have the same good interests second of all importantly i think it's a good way of highlighting facets of the communities that do need improvement i don't think it is true that like every minority culture by virtue of being like disadvantaged in some way or another is therefore immune from criticism lots of cultures that are minorities insofar as like everyone could improve in some ways have aspects of themselves would be good to improve and one of the best ways of doing this is someone internal from that community like highlighting the shitty bits of that community right like maybe tiger parenting goes too far in various bits like asian communities for instance maybe it is true that like people in african-american communities like indulge too much in gangster culture i'm not saying these are universally things that are true but these are things that are worthy of this sky argument is made externally or not by someone who feels like an authentic member of that community by comedians who have a unique position i'll take a py if closing has one what are your structural reasons for not like being particularly nuanced in the discussion beyond just minorities understand and therefore do it better i think like these i mean there's a pretty good reason right like i don't think like i i i'll ask you this like if you want to claim there's like some nonsense debate or reason why comedians will be bad literally name like name three and i will like concede the debates you like comedians who are like doing their job who are more prominent than people like dave chappelle or the people on fresh off the boat for example because they're just like empirically not true okay and the important thing that i was saying is that there's like a way of authentically highlighting bad facets of the culture that means you can get criticism and discussions of these sorts of things and you can actually productive change and comedy is one of the few areas that is capable of doing that in so far it's like the people enjoy they're receptive to they're likely to consume for large extent in a way they simply do not when they proceed with a lecture i do not think you can like face comedy that is like not sort of in some sense or some perception derogatory to these cultures insofar as you're trying to critique it and point out why it is funny in a way that is going to be as effective as this sort of change i think this sort of comedy a is pretty funny b he's pretty good at making people like me more receptive and think about these discussions and sees is better at making minority communities change bad things about themselves that's why we oppose thank you we welcome deputy prime minister can you can you hear me now sorry for that okay thank you just one second three two one okay a couple of problems with all those case go as follows one as we said in our framing the correct stance that op should say have in this debate is that their comedy should be based on this meaning that the most important crucial part of the comment that is presented by comedians should be talking about not race but stereotypes and slurs about these things what we tell you is that obviously this is going to be a part of a comedy we're not going to not not pro we don't believe they should never talk about this but that it should be smaller part of it or if opportunity presents they should say that with that being said i'm unclear why the over why or will all the overwhelming narrative among comedians should be what opening up is arguing because it seems to me as if they are having a case whereas we say that these things are never going uh are never going to be case second point is that we are talking about comedians and comedians especially specifically so we are not talking about shows like bunda boondocks if i'm pronouncing it correctly which is high production cartoon that had many people working around it for a couple of years in order to produce such a quality humor that relies on this so we're talking about comedians in general and most comedians in general are not good comedians as most people who do any job in the world are not particularly good at their job especially in such a competitive environment as stand-up comedy uh stand-up comedy and things like that so also the video is the case is that comedians does not equal uh i don't know dave chappelle and louis ck but rather equals the subset of very mediocre to poor comedians who are not going to be so good at conceptualizing their humors and they're saying oh but people are going to tune in into this and they're now going to watch more of these people they're going to watch more people about this who responds to this one they're in general going to watch comedy because they find it funny or because they in general like to watch stand-up comedy or because they got they got recommendations by their friends am i clear while just talking about racial slurs is going to be the essential part but not the most the crucial thing is what they're propping that in general they believe that their comedy should be based on this meaning that in their world for both oppositions what is necessary is now all black comedians are focusing their comedy on this meaning that it is going to be even less likely that people are going to tune in to into black comedians because on their world in general humor of black comedians is less diversified meaning more meaning more boring meaning that they're that they're going to watch much less people and even in that regard they're going to watch a voice the important framing in this context is that we believe that in general it would be bad that comedians based in humor on any single particular issue just because it makes them lose the lose just because it makes them lose uh lose their voice because it's boring if everyone talks about it right there's just going to be less market for in general minority comedians if they're so uh uh if they're so homogenous in if they're so homogeneous in what they're speaking then they say oh but people can just understand the humor no people who watch things are not like you know university educated people who don't understand social nuances but rather you know like the statistics something like 30 something percent of citizens of the us cannot show where you know italy is on the map okay most people are not educated about much less uh much much much less complicated issues than things that relate to race uh race gender and such things and they say oh but they're going to see it you know they're going to view this as because they're part of the minority they're now going to how to say uh have new ones into how they're expressing this one i told you most people who do their job are at their job but second and most importantly if everyone in the part of group is doing this exact same comedy the only way literally that you differentiate yourself is being the the more the most brutal and the most harsh in portraying these stereotypes and slurs meaning that if now all black comedians are focusing on this that the most popular ones are necessarily going to be those who are the most extreme right those who go to the highest possible ceilings in terms of depicting this slur and competitors long-term producing horrible consequences that that that milos talks about so even bad comedians are likely to crowd out the good ones just because they're willing to go just because they're willing uh uh that they're willing to go to the extreme i want to take a question from closing please opening okay dave chappelle chris rock eddie murphy three of the most prominent black comedians who all talk about this stuff using stereotypes but a nuanced way at times like your case is like devoid of reality and so far as you keep talking about these terrible prominent comedians who you cannot name and who do not exist yeah but in my opinion in our opinion dave chappelle does not fall on your side because dave chappelle talks about many other social issues regarding race regarding life in america regarding politics and so on and so on and occasionally does you know coming into slurs his background where he grew up and stuff like that by no means is his comedy based on this and this enters essentially this enters fantastically about our point of essentialization what is the problem with being a minority in serbia if you're a bosnian citizen right you have a bosnian friend everyone does we call all people who are from bosnia bosnia okay we say hey bosnian what's up and what does it speak for if in general we perceive minorities because they are minority as that is the most important part of their identity right this is how we essentialize them everyone who is part of dominant majority group where xiaomi's argument becomes significantly more important is that for you know the market which has so much potential to change certain you know social norms that exist in our society because people are funny and gender and generally likable we create long-term okay long-term very bad consequences in terms of this essentialization what do we want from comedy okay what i want is if i see a black comedian i don't want most people who watch to think that the most important part about black comedian is him being black the most importantly want is that people see them as a human beings who okay come from particular backgrounds and they of course are going to talk about racism and about their backgrounds and to correct jokes about it from uh from time to time but if top 10 comedians in the world are only talking about or mostly talking about slurs in these kind of things the the perception okay your in your mind perception about is going to be essentializing you're going to be much much more likely to see them only as black why is this so important it is because in your world when they want to send a message that can bring you know challenges to certain to to to certain dominant norms where it's in question sexism or question racism their voice is significantly diminished because how people perceive them is someone who is you know only black or only promiscuous woman and all and all the other things like that which is the extent to which ovo and we want to have this social change and we agree that impacts of this are going to be rather minor in terms of whole society this argument completely goes on our side of the house because if they should fail focus is solely on this kind of humor okay then when he starts talking about republican party people would say he's just another black comedian there is nothing significantly interesting to look to it has been enjoyment debating this competition and i'm very proud to propose thank you we now welcome the deputy leader for position sorry one sec just getting a timer okay can you hear me okay maybe yes no yes okay cool good go away wow okay um all right that was inconvenient sorry so it's taken us about three speeches but we've already managed from opening government to row us into a discussion where someone's going to sit at the back during your stand-up routine count how many times you say the n-word if you sit three times that's probably not basing so it's okay if you say it four times now your routine is based on this and therefore it's not okay this is an extremely tedious soft prop we're gonna deal with it anyway we would rather have the debate in a more meaningful sense but we will play their silly game if they want to do it so two things in this speech firstly i'm going to look at the question of why it necessarily must be to a degree uh like offensive stereotype slurs etc to get the benefits we want and secondly i'll look at those benefits specifically why access and accessibility is the number one aim of these comics particularly in the kinds of circumstances we are talking about because no this debate doesn't purely take place in 2020 u.s comedy or uk comedy it takes place all over the world where there are different tolerances and acceptabilities for what can be said who can even participate and we posit therefore that the biggest single benefit we can get is one about accessibility so uh firstly on offensiveness uh versus slurs we think this is kind of a false distinction first thing to note is that it doesn't necessarily a priority mean you're being offensive just to use stereotypes many stereotypes have at least some basis in truth they're not able to be critiqued and talked about in ways that are not point-blank offensive secondly the barometer of offense is internal and is relative so while one black person might see chris rock's comedy as offensive another might see it as speaking to their own experience we think that is a valuable platform that we shouldn't just entirely remove as of fuji next we said that the best judge of where this line is is the comedian which is kind of the poi that we got from cg we said is for a couple of reasons firstly they've grown up in this community so they know the kind of experiences they're likely to be subjected to secondly they are approximate directly through criticism when people from their own community say this was too far they will know it is too far thirdly they are likely to do many things like stand-ups test their routines many many times before they get on the tv they will check and balance receive feedback and balance these things relatively well i think if they do take it too far there are corrective mechanisms you have strong incentives to not just be wildly offensive for the sake of being offensive because no one will ever hire you again secondly why is basing it and bridging and being offensive useful because it bridges these devices helpfully yanko tells us that like 50 of americans don't know where italy is for the same reason 50 of americans honestly don't know that much about let's say asian-american culture hence having a comic who is able to use those experiences that a majority audience would have in common with them because they go into it with a bunch of weird stereotypes about oh all asians want to be doctors or whatever means that they can latch onto that and use that as a platform to connect with an audience that otherwise would have no way into that this is crucial for connection but it's also crucial for access because no one's going to book you if the only people who find your comedy funny are your own minority it traps you in certain circles that is not good next on sensationism well that just is an inherent value to being sensations if you are the one comedian who is willing to in say 1980s america when chris rock does his famous n-words versus black people routine if you're the one comedian who's willing to do that people are going to hire you in a way that they wouldn't the thing about sarcasm thirdly is just irrelevant because nowhere in the motion to say sarcasm or subtle these things can be extremely overt as indeed the boondocks is which is also just to be clear like who do you think wrote the boondocks it was comedians obviously that's in the debate so anyway fourthly and lastly on the idea of basing why is basing important as we pointed out the softest prop since their own world's final secondly this is probably in easily inverted in that we could say well maybe 60 percent of chris rock's comedian should be based on stereotype but 40 should be biting social critique so i don't see where the like nuance line is that makes that case work but here are four additional reasons why this matters firstly routines and comedians need a hook you need something identifiable to make people see a poster on the tube and be like i actually want to go to that and maybe the hook the ideas like i know that shapi kosandi is the female iranian comedian who makes jokes about what it's like to be an iranian immigrant in the uk that is a valuable perspective but one that i would i wouldn't go and see her if i was just like i don't know what she's about she's just one amongst many saturated comedians in this market she has an identity but identity is also useful for bookers and hirers when people want to have someone on their tv show when they want to have someone make a social critique when they want to have someone talk about these experiences that is important secondly com and like so this is important for routines but it's also important for comics in general for the same reasons about thirdly you can change your routines you can change your identity over time you see comics stop from slapstick go to character acting go to these things there is no reason that you are necessarily pigeonholed unless you are literally the only person doing this kind of comedy which is the fourth response they say we have to defend all black people doing this what of course no we don't we say that some can do it if they want to indeed it's probably preferable if you are the first and only comedian of that identity group practicing that this is a uniquely useful way of breaking into that community and then five ten years down the time there are now like huge numbers of black comedians in america who don't need to rely on this precisely for this reason so it's the same thing with pigeonholing right we think that the only reason they bring this up is we're able to meaningfully talk about this we're able to meaningfully note that amy schumer did call out this criticism said it was unfair we can have a discussion about it because she pioneered that in the first place to get us to a point where we can have these more meaningful conversations we don't think there's a race to the bottom of extremes because there are natural corrective mechanisms and because we exist in a wide variety of circumstances so accessibility in the power of comedy before that cg most of these comedians come from underprivileged backgrounds where they have to be misfits within their communities in order to gain success in this career presumably these are not people with a lot of intense honestly the sad truth is that most of the minority comedians in the uk all went to cambridge anyway so it's like tip of the iceberg going down i don't think that's true i think even if you're like the most misfitting asian american you probably understand the asian american experience a lot better than the white people who would make these jokes instead silly idea so anyway why is accessibility important as we pointed out to no response most of these things are controlled at a high level by particular groups of people that often come from particular societies like the footlights in cambridge or whatever which means they have particular ideas about what it means to be comic what it means to be funny it means that you're in a saturated market where there are huge numbers of communities if you can leverage your dad is really useful because that is what's going to get you the pioneer that is what got chris rock his tv shows in the first place because he was sensational because he was the only person making these jokes and that was not something that could be done if he just did relatively tame comedy that wasn't based on these ideas because as we pointed out these are the ideas that connect with both a minority and a majority experience who are uninformed this is why bases are important and what this break-in allows to do is yes in the future he goes on to talk about these biting social issues and one nice barack obama mentioned it in like his senate campaign in whenever that was um and also his presidential one probably i don't know but the point is that he's able because he's able to make these changes he's able to use his platform to create a market now hiring execs know that there is a market for black comedy they will hire other people that diversity of opinions now we have black comics who don't need to speak about this because someone did the hard work in the past unable to make it informed choose maybe someone is going to call amy schumer's slide and she doesn't like it but she's able to make that choice because she knows she's trading off that degree of like potential offensiveness as obviously 4chan would do anyway to a degree of um success and then what it does is it bridges the divide chris rock can hide his own warm-up acts he gets his own tv shows he creates a market because now black people know that comedy is for them and not a bunch of old white men sitting in a smoky comedy club in soho ultimately the power of comedy is only useful if people go and see your shows in the first place that's what we need we allow these people to make an informed choice to when it's appropriate use their identity weaponize it the same for racial minorities it's the same for women it's same for all minority groups so proud to oppose thank you we welcome member of government i'll keep my video off of if that's okay because i have really bad internet sure um starting in three two one oh burden pushes us and says if we name three bad comedians will win the debate lily duvall eddie griffin kevin hart we win the debate i think kevin hart is really terrible he so portrays the stereotypical black man he cheated on his wife and jokes about his dick i think these are the ways in which these actors have ways of pernicious incentives and if you look at the opening half deadlock it is based on a lot of impacts that can come out of scenarios but the analysis of how likely that scenario is is very limited i think there's one piece of analysis from og which is there's a race to being more offensive there's one piece of analysis from oh which is minorities generally have connections and they understand it if we can break this like i'm like convincingly and show you that in most cases the balance between nuanced discussion shifts to insult because these incentives exist for comedians we win the opening half already secondly we'll talk about the ways in which perceptions are shaped and why that's better and give you more far more nuanced impactful analysis than og did number one we think there are incentive structures on five different layers for which these comedians are likely to shift more towards insult rather than portrayal of stories before going into the analysis i just want to clarify some things we are opposed to white people making these same jokes anyway i understand that's not a part of this debate but we're happy to criticize them number two we're okay with light comedy that doesn't have any and all racist connotations we're not going to be soft which uh like og and we'll just say that we'll not use them at all we'll be like john oliver and just not have racist comedy but have liked storytelling and get away with i understand that sort of part of this debate we i think we can shape narratives in order to push towards it five structural reasons uh starting from like really simple stuff to more sophisticated stuff number one i think these people are poor they want money most consumers of comedy are from the majority they're rich people who don't want to feel attacked in that way in order to please them you often have to cater to their interests minority people are poor they don't buy your comedy number two let's say these people build up political capital at a point in time where they build up political capital you still have to cater to your core consumer base i.e even if you have some part of the story it will be small and subtle and spending like five or six minutes on and it's unlikely that it'll become a nuanced story at a point in time where the trade-off involves attacking people in order to make it nuance this is because the uh life experience of a minority is often antithetical to that of the majority most of your terrible experiences are because the majority oppressed you you have to attack them in order to sell that story in order to do that third here's where we get more sophisticated these people are misfits i'm not being stereotypical indian parents don't like their children becoming comedians in order for you to become a comedian you often have to go against your family and often have to be the social reject within your family if you're not one of these people you're likely to be privileged that's what or concedes to this is how we engage if you're from cambridge and an indian you know nothing about the indian experience from a vulnerable background and you cracking racist jokes about it means you're less likely to understand what it's like fourth uh there's a competitive industry where there's a very unique set of usps that each comedian has the moment you step beyond it and you go into like undiscovered territory you're likely to become political and like you know blocked down that's why hassan minhaj's show got cancelled because he didn't want to trash on his own community but wanted to talk about social issues that's when funding that is in the hands of corporations takes money away from you that's when the majority creates backlash against you the competitive industry is one where also creativity is difficult that's literally why john oliver is the only one that makes his kind of comedy no one else can come up with new versions of it because it's difficult so you're likely to sell your usp which is crashing on your own community fifth there's a offensive culture in comedy i'll give credit for og for stating this but the reason is because and this is where we add to og analysis the people want to pay a premium to watch comedy comedy doesn't change your life it just gives you satisfaction in order for you to spend money you have to see something different in it than what you get in everyday life everyday life has protected speech states often don't allow you to be racist states often don't allow you to express what your inner thoughts are comedy is a unique safe space where people pay money to see something that is not normal in everyday society that's why the race for offensiveness exists because people pay money for something they don't get in everyday life that's how we add to og what does all of this analysis prove number one or loses because everything they have to prove depends on not having these mechanisms it proves that the line between sarcasm and the stories through it shifts towards insults and this also proves that even if there's one individual dave chappelle the vast majority of the industry tilts towards it why is this so very immoral and i'm happy to take a pi from ceo they seem awfully silent throughout this debate um we think that uh minorities suffer in this process this is because when you're a person of this minority and you enter this comedy house you're likely to suffer a lot of terrible experiences this is because you're reminded of your vivid representations of your life experiences that are ghastly and made trivial so i understand og says that but what's the real life impact of this number one you opt out of the comedy itself you stop buying the comedy that your own community sells obviously you already don't go to the you know uh white people's comedy this creates a cyclical problem the less minorities that consume your comedy the more you're less likely to cater to them and the more you're likely to shift to white people and what they want so the way this works is it's a cycle you hurt people they opt out you feed into the perpetual cursor even more and going into the future you insult these people even more the conclusion is the only outcome you get is money made i think any team that tries to prove this money earned is moral is not going to win this debate um i'll take one from ceo yeah thanks um i mean given a broadly liberal candle culture at work in society why will comedians just debase themselves by being openly racist this is also very likely to get their shows cancelled uh because white people like it i think that's how white people are ask them not me i'm bangladeshi i think the way this works is lastly the impacts that are different from og you influence subconscious perceptions this is in two additional mechanisms than what og gives you number one it influences the perception that people in positions of power can insult those in inferiority i.e because someone from their own community who's in a position of power insults them presumably the only difference is that you have to get to a position of power in order to exercise it nothing else number two there are ways in which this seeps in security sajid i think i lost you am i the only one can everyone else hear this talk for confirmation after you said it's insecurity you disappeared yeah i have the time it's 6 39 just to be clear okay um fine i'll start restart from 6 39 please don't hit me if i over time on my watch i'll i'll trust you guys to do it cool cool um starting in three two one okay this is i think he's we heard nothing sergeant you muted yourself can you hear me now redo yes okay sorry sorry sorry my bad um i i approximately have how many seconds about 20 20. okay cool starting in three two one so what this does is it feeds insecurity because the moment you hear the word terrorist there's some part of you subconsciously that feels insecure about it no matter how much nuanced discussion you have often voting is irrational and it's based on low threshold biases so the fact that there's some level of insecurity fed into you means that you're more likely to confirm it the reason this is exclusive is even if a white person does it you can say that that's an insult when your own community does it it reconfirms it far more because it's more likely to be believed to be true because of the reasons all says they understand it better that's the subconscious bias that ooo themselves fall into that's why you're more likely to be insecure and have the problems that we see in the status quo and i guess i don't have time but i think we already won thank you um we welcome member of opposition all right so i have been given marching orders to make this debate a bit more funny um and all i can come up with is that i think it's really upsetting the amount of sheer anti-australian bias and evidence throughout this entire tournament i think it's good that as we have a debate an important issue about discrimination just recognize that and try and move forward from this um i want to talk about two things firstly how comedy actually works specifically how it's multi-vocal how the fact that comedy is inherently ambiguous in place of tension to the meanings of certain actions means that actually it can spread good messages to both people in the in-group and the out group secondly i just want to talk about reclaiming traumatic experience in general why that's very important for minorities before that there's some rebuttal to the cg they give us a whole bunch of incentives about why everyone will race to the bottom i think these are just quite impossible you tell us that you know you will race to the bottom to be a race traitor because it's by insulting your own race that you make money firstly i think lots of white people who watch comedy view themselves very liberal and watch comedy to get a sense of like moral superiority right like i can watch comedy which insults me as a majority and still recognize my falsehood secondly i think comedians probably still value the friends and family and communities from which they come i think becoming a race trainer actually probably is just psychologically quite a difficult thing for them but it turns into just open insults it just seems to me this couldn't survive in an age of cancer culture where people are very sensitive to these things we viciously criticize people in the media and executives probably want to keep you on then they also say well you too little time to make these jokes so you can't do the new ones i'm going to explain to you later why in order for something to be funny it needs to be more than just in something and more than just needs to integrate some kind of tension some kind of critique so the nuance here does not come from the amount of time you spend on something it comes in front you made it funny um lastly they said oh you know people who do this comedy often work from literally minority well that's probably true but that doesn't mean you don't have meaningful experiences in common many comedians who went to good universities were often tiger parented into being quite academically right seems to me they would have quite a good voice on these things chappie kosandi had a good education but she is still stopped on the street and looked at as if she's terrorists when she goes on the thing lisa presumably still thinks we ought to talk about lastly they say you you sort of like put in irrational biases and people said because you associate muslims of terrorists know that these stereotypes already exist at the behest of people like nigel farage and the entire apparatus the question is can you associate in the minds of people those stereotypes with an implicit critique which comes not in the form of an essay by an academic or an op-ed but in the form of a comedic routine which showed up how it observed that particular steroid so first point of extension how do we think comedy actually works we think something is not funny if it just tells the truth or what you believe is the truth therefore a person who is genuinely a white supremacist who sees someone acting up a gross stereotype has nothing to find funny in that because that's just what they genuinely believe the world to be what makes comedy funny is that it does something more to that it exaggerates that or implicitly assumes that stereotype exists in a certain view of whom you disagree with right often this happens via exaggeration that is why for instance a black person or a chinese person could laugh at something with you know which parody stereotypes about them because they recognize it's true but also recognize how absurd it is so how does this absurdity often come about a because the stereotype is implicitly portrayed as being in the eyes of a white person i.e when a black person acts out those stereotypes they're not actually being a stereotype they're implying that this is how white people see black people and what is funny about it why people want to watch it it's because they see how absurd is at least that is why let's say the black community would want to watch it to see how absurd it is the white community probably watches it because they want to be confronted on some level with the absurdity of their own views and the moral superiority from getting those games right so i've seen those views presented so that kind of tension and ambiguity allows for both groups to see something positive in it but the second thing about this kind of multiple counting is that it often comes from their own personal experiences so when shaky kazandi does her little i'm a terrorist routine right or dave chappelle pretends to be a blind white blind black person a blind uh black person who doesn't know they're actually black what happens is that they're actually narrating their personal experiences about how these stereotypes were projected onto them and how they related to it what is funny is a thing which was irreverent and ultimately did not allow for themselves to just become reduced to a victim right that's incredibly empowering for that community all this means is that all these community routines what is funny about these things is an implicit critique about the stereotype embedded within these things that's incredibly useful because the fact that you can reach out to people who are not liberal who are not in your in group means that those sort of stereotypes become associated with these kinds of critiques and the fact that the critique is not you know arguments but narrative means it's more staying power people are more likely to recall these things right if you see shaky kazandi's routine and you see a muslim person you know bored an aeroplane you're probably going to think well you know this probably feels quite difficult for them if i react to them in a particular way we also hear coming from the gov there's a lot of backlash because this is exclusive right um we don't allow white people to tell these sorts of jokes but we think that's actually really powerful right um because this is something we this is not something complicated we all do this in daily life if i have a white friend and i go to his house very often and i call that his white trash hut we all understand that i can call his house a white trash cart because with that relationship but i can't do that with a stranger i've just met right so the fact that we have this discourse about who is allowed to make these strokes actually strengthens the like the group identity we're talking about here it allows us to say that what ignites this community is the fact that the history of oppression and history of being insulted and little for this identity and that discussion is incredibly useful for calling attention to these kinds of injustices well let's talk about reclamation and the benefits of humor in the enterprise in specific uh yeah i'll take one from cg now actually i think these are like your analysis applies an abstract there's no structural analysis for why this is the likely interpretation in most cases it is a possible interpretation in some cases i i i think i've said that actually because you know if you are genuinely a racist and you watch a routine about stereotypes i think it'll be quite hard for you to find it funny because what's funny about it if you just believe it to be true you must have some kind of self-awareness or some kind of potential tension to find it funny right so and presumably people don't watch stuff unless they find it funny so we think there's a self-selection benefit here let's talk about reclamation we think that there's huge psychological burden on minorities who go through the world being subjected to these stereotypes um these sort of daily slurs that kind of historical baggage and we know the psychological impact is real we know because we can measure the rates of self-harm suicide ideation among minorities while subjected to this when a comedian translate that pulse translates the personal trauma into something which is defiant into something which is empowering into something which my soo points out shine a a nuanced light on real problems in your community that allows you as a human being to grapple with that in a much more effective way psychologically and the reason why this point is important is because it holds true regardless of what community you live in what the political circumstances are the fact that you managed to be someone who shares your identity viewing those things is an empowering way is universally a good thing we are very proud to oppose thank you we welcome the last speaker on the government bench available the entire opposition bench more have tried to explain what happens if a comedian tries their level best to try to use their comedy based on stereotypes and slurs for good absolutely not really engaging on the premise of this debate which is what is the incentive structure and i think closing is the one that has been most comprehensive and analyzing the comp the incentive structures of these comedians in terms of what comedy they're likely to portray in the first place so if we can prove this premise we will automatically win this debate but secondly even if we assume they're like trying to do their best we will explain why we win either way but first on incentives why they are not liked to do so firstly i think we explained um opening opposition says oh because if you offend people you're not likely to be hired back the problem is of course that the audience is different right because the person you are primarily offending is a minority person in that audience as opposed to the rest of the people who are laughing along with you so you are actually creating more demand for you you are not actually creating those corrective mechanisms they talked about where you can practice again come back in fact you are getting positive reception of this ashish comes and says oh but cancel culture is a thing the reality okay i will have like three different reasons like three things right first of all i think the fact that when you people go against you and try to create a cancelled culture within comedy circles that's actually street cred because that means other the the people who are trying to attack comedy are coming after you which means you're actually more likely to be able to be to be received within the more attraction there the thing i would like to say is that this is very uh what they call it it's very untrue that this cancel culture is real thing we like to pretend it is but it is not right louis ck literally came back to comedy after committing sexual misconduct and breaking laws like nobody's cancelling anyone for cracking racist jokes unfortunate reality is people don't live in this liberal circle for some reason ashish assumes community circles do the third thing to say here even if we assume the absolute best case that there's a like a canceled culture going around the truth is that this cancer culture is very limited to a very western context of hyper liberal like a hyper like you know where hyperliberal ideas are even accepted in the first place because this debate also must exist in comedy cultures around the world but you're also looking at much less like communities which are much more tolerant of these kinds of abusive behavior towards their minorities right you're literally looking at me i have literally faced this when i've gone to a comedy club and people have made jokes in bangladesh about how hindus are dirty right and this is something that the hindu committee made fun of about their own houses this is not something that makes people feel comfortable and this is not something that gets them can get cancelled in a real world sense the next thing i want to say is that above the fact that catering to this audience that i think has it massively able to make sure made sure to present to you but also because not only uh this also creates a cycle where once you get that script credibility it doesn't take into account all argument which is that once you get credibility you can now change your like you know like change your message you can't because you have a certain type of following that you want to cater to and you don't we do anything incentives align that way ashish comes up and says look if it is funny it is funny if you exaggerate things correct but what types of exaggeration are likely to be created we don't think that the types of exaggeration that is easy and likely to get reactions in terms of being funny are the likes that are critiquing and are able to send a subtle message the ones that are easier is probably actually to make worse fat jokes for example that actually make people funny because it's so exaggerated that people don't just automatically think it's absurd people just laugh at their fat friend because of how you exaggerated that joke in the first place right so we don't think that happens and we think the incentive structure is therefore aligned for these comedians to necessarily be have those incentives to look down of course then they said ah but guys you're you're accountable to your own community i think firstly something explained how these are often people who are misfits they're not likely to be accountable to their communities i think secondly many of them are far far more privileged than the rest of their committee and don't share those experiences in the first place thirdly i think often a lot of these people often belong to some groups of these communities where these are edgy parts of the community that they belong to the comedy circle which means that the accountability is actually to a different subgroup of the community to encourage this behavior if anything in the first place so the incentive structures that we have proven in this debate that kinds of people go and do comedy means that overwhelmingly they normalize these kinds of situations where people are looked down on they normalize stereotypes they normalize slurs automatically making us win this debate before i move on opening opposition so you said there is a white audiences love racism comics never get cancelled so this market exists always is it therefore jokes are made by jeff dunham or by ramesh ranganathan so firstly i think you can address these issues in a different way as opposed to actually basing it around this uh what do you call it like stereotypes and slurs in the first place that's number one but number two when you don't actually go ahead and use the stereotypes and slurs that actually gives you more credibility to be able to call out these jeff dynams and as a comedian who is inside that circle now you have the power to slowly change the kind of narrative in the first place assuming you are good like opening opposition does but okay now let's assume these people want to do good magically these are these comedians who actually want to like you know talk about their struggles and so on and so forth firstly i think opening opposition says look this gives them additional access this is obviously very condescending to comedians pretending as if like slurs and stereotypes are the only way they can build bridges of communi like like sim comic uh what they call commonality through which they can share right look i can talk about how the fact that i went to a curry place and actually what you call curry place and that gave me like a stomachache that is not necessarily a stereotype that is like something true if you get more spices you're more likely to get it that is something that british people can relate to because they have a lot of indian restaurants you don't need to go and be like oh i'm from indian places and then therefore like you know i have a smelly household you don't need to do that in order to establish a sense of commonality because the world is pretty intertwined for you to be able to find a lot of different other types of commonality with these people in the first place we don't think people are that separate as they would like to suggest the second thing then ashish comes up and says oh but you know we want to be able for people to reclaim their traumatic experiences properly everything we're able to do it okay first of all this obviously massively assumes that this person is actually able to reclaim the traumatic experience because it's very difficult to do to do so through a comedy piece right i think that's number one number two in the vast majority of instances when like vast majority of instances it is extraordinarily difficult to reclaim an identity that has been pushed down on you for decades if not centuries in through a comedy piece we don't think it gets interpreted that way or you even feel you're even likely to feel that way in the first place when the dominant narrative is something entirely but the third thing and i will do this this is where closing government gives the trade-off that opening government is not right because even if you can reclaim something right and if you can do some social change why do we win this debate oj correctly proves that some people will feel hurt as a result of this why did we approve will on this clash as well because we told you that these people opted out first of all and therefore made you have a cycle cycle which means you no longer cater to them so even if you started off well trying to cater to them and you wanted to reclaim this trauma your incentive structures change but secondly and we told you that it is incredibly uh you should not do it because these are likely people who are the most vulnerable who are the ones who are most likely have gone through the trauma which is why they were triggered in the first place so we don't think you should be trading off the most vulnerable of your community for on your side that's how closing government wins this debate paper falls thank you and we welcome the opposition hi um can i check you guys can hear me all right cool so the reason why i think closing opposition takes this debate is because unlike something that i've always believed about sajid ashish actually understands how humor works and i think that that is the important bit or the mechanization that exists in this particular debate that no one else has ever talked about beyond just saying that perhaps it could be centralizing perhaps it could not be but the thing is this motion rests upon whether or not comedians are actually able to generate the kind of jokes that makes people want to watch them because presumably the exposure that you get is a comedian and therefore the influence that you have in the kind of societies that are around you is exactly proportional to how many people actually find you funny so before that let's talk about closing government i think closing government's case hinges upon this characterization that audiences are racist and audiences want to see a comic race to the bottom because they're just inherently racist that way note that the premises at which this happens is incredibly shaky all sajid and mubarak tell us is this one letter that says minorities don't watch your comedy because minorities don't have the money to that is just empirically untrue in the most number of circumstances especially because we think that many comics especially uh minority comics if it is true that there's a situation in which they are continually being sidelined at the current moment often grow out of small bars in which the majority of the audience are in fact members of their own communities who are the ones who are the most incentivized to see jokes by a person that represents themselves which therefore means that if you're overtly exaggerating in the way that you kind of like put down your own community why on earth would he ever find you funny but secondly if it was true in mubarak's more extreme characterization the individuals really just wanted to see the world burn and it's not that a joke that goes haha you're so fat you're really really fat and it just adds many many more really because that seems to be how they jokes were if those are the kind of circumstances in which the only way they could find a person funny because they race down to the bottom it's really uncertain in this particular debate why exactly the individual being of a minority status and saying these stereotypes is going to make a humongous amount of difference to the kind of terrifying racism that exists in those worlds already presumably if people hold such stereotypically racist views to the point where they find those kind of exaggerations funny first of all i just don't think they think it's very funny because they probably just think it's true but also i just uncertain why the individual doing it being a minority is a worse than a majority also doing it because presumably they find those things equally funny to them anyway but secondarily what mubarak then says is ah but now you decentralize them in a way that you make individuals they want to speak up lose credibility because you can point to this minority comedian and say ah but this person's making fun of themselves you need to take it easy like presumably as ashish points out we need to talk about this in a more nuanced characterization because like i said in overwhelming situations it's neither funny nor does it make a significant amount of difference so where exactly does comedy make the most uh where exactly does this comedy tend to happen in the most look the point of comedy and what makes it uniquely funny is that this form of edgy humor where you debate debase or like make stereotypes or slurs of yourself it's often considered edgy humor in which individuals find that humor both from the fact that it's exaggeration and truth but also from the fact that you're towing a precarious line between whether or not the humor is seen to be unacceptable at which point crosses over into not being funny any longer but also teetering on the edge at which you think that it's kind of edgy it's kind of funny because the person's making these forms of exaggeration there is a unique form of humor which is something that i think solves a lot of the problems that the government bench talks about because presumably these forms of humor affects the uh the people who choose to watch these forms of humor are individuals who are aware of that specific cancer culture that are aware of like standards in which these things become unacceptable but are willing to go there so they can be confronted with certain stereotypes and exaggeration of those stereotypes in a way that is humorous to them this therefore means that in order for a comic to be successful in these situations they must be able to have an audience that is able to understand that these things are not actually true but are in fact exaggerations but why is that then important and different i think it's important and different because a lot of what humor does in this circumstance is that you laugh first but post facto that laughing a lot of investigation happen what exactly does humans inherently based on given it's inherently based on this particular balance which is i think something oh never actually mechanizes you just said it shines a light on things but don't explain how um i think that what happens now is that individuals become more aware of their confrontation and more aware of why exactly these things are considered to be exaggeration which is a very implicit way of making people like really look at their own circumstances so i think that's great but secondly let's just talk about reclamation because i don't think that anyone in the government better deals with this before i go into that i'll take one from og so you get by because you can differentiate your comedy on style things you say charisma and edginess not sure why you have to base your comedy and stereotypes to get buy-in from the wider population i mean you can yeah that's so that i'm that's where i'm moving on to now but presumably like that is a that people doesn't make sense because you can do a lot of different kinds of comedies the question is just whether or not this specific form of comedy is one that we're willing to accept but i'm gonna move on to why we think it's important that minorities actually do reclaim these forms of stereotypes so i think we hear very little from this from the government bench closing government's only response to say uh but reclamation doesn't really happen when it's a race to the bottom here are some things that i think are just true uh in terms of observation oppressed minorities tend to also be the ones that make fun of themselves the most um and the reason for that is actually very simple which is that a lot of these individuals are often people who have a shared and unique experience that they actually want to be able to interrogate but because the structures that surround them are not particularly able to do so so firstly this is a very non-hostile in which they're able to do this but also ashish tells you that precisely because this joke um often has to do with some sort of discursiveness about who can make these jokes again about the point of like what is unacceptable humor and what is actually funny because of these forms of investigation the fact they can feel like you're all in this together that you all can understand where this joke comes from then you can see the premises on which this exaggeration is formed on and because you can relate to it very much that is the reason why we can formulate better reclamation and better forms of complexities for groups that are otherwise unrepresented in this course so for instance the fact that uh asian and indians for example are also things that i could potentially be able to relate to a lot more when shows like fresh off the boat which one you want to talk about for example exists in a way that placeable stereotypes such that i feel like i'm being represented immediately to show that i have an in-group as well but on top of that the last thing to know is what exactly what else about this characterization of this that that matters i think a lot of gov banter's analysis presumes that these forms of humor always result in the minority losing out because of ex-era and slav haha they are worse off in the majority but often one of the best forms of comic relief is when minorities are able to weaponize these stereotypes to show how they can eventually come up on top like for instance being lasted in school because you were a nerd for example and often the comic ends up by being like aha but then i got into a good school and the white guy didn't for instance like those are also presumably alternative forms of humor that similarly exists that i think they are like doesn't deal with they just presume that people will be bad but that's not really funny thank you everyone for an excellent debate
