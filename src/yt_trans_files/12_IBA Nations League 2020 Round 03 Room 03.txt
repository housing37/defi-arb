Transcript:
 that's fine as well all right you know we're good to go okay yeah and if anything else like you guys can withdraw consent later on um i will keep time using what i think time capped and then if but i suggest you guys keep your own times as well that is not time kept that is a vpn um okay without further ado i now invite the prime minister okay okay three two recognize that the power of these companies has genuinely not only become absurd but has become corrosive of even the most basic tenets of democracy and of people deciding what they want to do with their lies and how they want to be governed and how they extended far beyond the spheres of you know commercial practices and pricing recognize that the anti-trust system has was created in an era in which this was not the case in which prices and quality of products were the only questions which uh which you know which companies answered and uh services they provided as benchmarks by and benchmarks by which those services can be assessed that is no longer the case given the massive involvement these companies have in social media in political lobbying and in the ability to sway decisions uh based on economic factors relating to their political impetus so first of all before we get into uh substantive a few clarifications as regards to what is the motion uh and and how we'll implement it so first of all this is uh this will mainly be about the company such as facebook or amazon now the types of threats but obviously we'll assess this on a case-by-case basis right right uh the types of threats to the democratic process we'll be looking out for are first of all political lobbying leading to political capture to such a degree in which you can never you cannot pass laws against these companies and cannot regulate them because they massively sponsor races and campaigns of politicians which are in government and thus gain favor and current favor for them such that they will never get um regulated given that will harm the re-election chances of any of these politicians um second of all the second thing we'll look out for is massive allowance and encouragement of propagation of fake news of disinformation and of electoral manipulation this is something that facebook a routinely engages in in terms of allowing it um in order to gain more profit and this looks like you know the fake classic fake news but also electron manipulation by uh foreign interferences see russia and in the u.s elections of 2016 and very likely 2020 invasion of thoughts trolls and so on which substantively corrode the ability of populations to keep informed and to vote um with information in mind with accurate information in mind as opposed to conspiracy theories first of all the third thing we'll look at is um using the economic cloud for political gain which results in further economic clout so for example amazon using its economic cloud to create a race to the bottom between regions within the united states because they force mayors and u.s states to lower health and safety regulations uh even if it's against the interests of their citizens because they have the size in order to compel that political decision because it's a race for the bottom of who gets that one amazon plant which is on the market for uh settlement now recognize this is a use of political capital and it's not regarding prices and so on now as regards to how we'll enact this breakup it's a standard breakup by natural product category so overwhelmingly all of these um companies have a variety of variety of types of products and series of products will split them up as makes more sense in terms of you know separate products which they offer and keep those separate we'll also set up the revenue streams the budgets will enforce different management upon each of the um each of the you know component companies and also they can't reunite or cooperate in any way afterwards now getting on into our arguments and i think we have three main points here um but before that i just want to make to clarify the note that anti-trust laws as we cur as we previously conceived it was about the free market right and about prices and the prices and quality of products the problem is the power of these companies has extended so much that it now breaches not only in the market in the economic marketplace but also in the marketplace of ideas right in the marketplace of voting of persuasion but also in the marketplace of political information and what people find out about but also in the marketplace of controlling your elected representatives due to their size in this scenario we tell you regulation does not work so you have to use anti-trust legislation which comes at a prior step before that um in order to to avoid these problems right um i also want to point out that often by the way these these um these effects on marketplace ideas um often have effects on price and welfare of uh welfare which their products created later on down the line but those are difficult to identify from the get-go and that's why you have to intervene on the on the democratic side first of all so now going on to our three standard points first of all i want to point out that this motion this policy has an important deterrence effect which importantly even without its considerations of what the breakup will look like has a massive imp leads from massive improvement to the status the reason it has deterrence effect is because you only need to make one company as an example of using this legislation um in the scenario of uh harming democratic principles and then all of the other companies will fall into line because breaking up essentially destroys their business as they've seen it but also note that this uh that this democratic interference isn't something inherent that these companies have to do or something that is critical to their success or economic uh uh sort of capital right so they'll be very willing to to trade it off in order to keep retaining so that company or just at the announcement of this policy or once an example has been said you gain massive benefits from that and mitigate all the harms from the get-go even without having to break up a lot of companies now second of all second point one brings you so clearly i've already touched upon the harms and how they're particularly harmful in terms of voting becoming irrelevant politicians not implementing the policies which their people voted them in for um that that you know people cannot get better rights and are oppressed by these companies really but also that products become more expensive and less quality and with less innovation not as an initial standpoint which an anti-trust regulator would see now but rather as an effect of something like the amazon crowding out of other competitors which means there's a race to the bottom in terms of democratic principles which leads the health and safety regulations to go down right now i also will now want to move on to fritovol what the why the size of these companies is a key factor which has to be addressed which results in these harms size is the problem because of five reasons first political fund raising in order to do political fund rate uh fundraising you need massive amounts of cash massive amounts of funds to be able to run these races if you don't have them you can exercise control second of all lack of competition if there's no competitors then another competitor can't gain an advantage by accepting the regulation there's only one in your field like amazon right then you can just refuse that regulation outright and there's no one to take up that competitive advantage of accepting the recreation third of all it's unlikely that these companies will be regulated because as i've said politically if so it's generally unlikely that these companies will be regulated because of political lobbying but even if you attempt to regulate them they'll lawyer up and start class action lawsuits because they have the money to do so and attack you fourth of all a lot of times uh first of all they a lot of times are an extremely potent and easy target for external interference because they're one their their size is massive facebook's size is massive which and covers the whole marketplace which which is such an easy target for the russians and there's no replacement for it if people don't like facebook they can't move to anywhere else because they own instagram they want anything else so that's the ripest target for political uh misinformation and interference and election if you get rid of size by breaking up that means that suddenly you don't have all these issues because there are alternatives there are competitors and no longer do size the size cause democratic all right i thank the speaker i now welcome leader of opposition okay check that my mic's working so i've been having tech problems great welfare is a broader category than vague threats to democracy it's about the ability for millions of consumers to access affordable products loans and powerful networks that uniquely come from economies of scale their model is going to fail in solving threats to the democratic process but deny consumers the myriad of benefits that come from larger corporations i'm going to start out by explaining our counter prop then refute pm and then get into two arguments firstly the benefits of big companies for consumers and then secondly why this will be highly politicized process and shut down the wrong kinds of companies into our counter prop firstly we support campaign finance legislation under our side of the house note we have a massive amount of fiat power to solve prop's problem this is because being broken up for having a big threat to the democratic process is obviously going to be very unpopular for companies under the status quo and therefore we can just symmetrically use the power to implement other policies that are probably going to be more popular than literally having you broken up as a corporation in addition to campaign finance legislation we would also have a push to regulate fake news and finally after the piece of characterization we support the push under the status quo that exists in a variety of states to regulate companies i.e like more stringent data requirements for facebook that is very politically plausible because people care about not having their data stolen people care about accurate information which is why these issues are becoming a lot more politically popular and it's a brief refutation in terms of solving a problem of political lobbying i don't think this actually applies because the problem is not that you have a few large corporations but rather when you have a myriad of small corporations they're still going to agglomerate around shared interest that is to say they also benefit from things like having lower regulations so even if each individual company has less money they don't shrink the pool of money overall there's going to be designated to things like political lobbying in terms of fake news also unclear how breaking up these companies would solve that problem like when facebook is broken up where are people gonna turn to news probably just smaller social media sites who also have incentives to propagate fake news but even less money to be able to do things like buffer against this in terms of deterrence this is nonsense because there's always going to be pressure to grow as a company in the short term there is massive pressure from shareholders to continue to grow when they care about things like quarterly earnings report and given that there is uncertainty about the exact time period where you're going to be broken up it's a far more rational choice on behalf of shareholders to continually just try and maximize the bottom line of your company because you get the guaranteed immediate impact of more capital first claim what are the benefits of big companies for consumers overall so we have to note that there are a large numbers of companies who they're going to break up who are not being broken up under the status quo because you're beneficial under their consumer welfare standards but due to like your large size and like they might find some politicians do you pose a threat to democracy given that why do you think it's really valuable to have a large like quantity of big companies operating multiple mechanisms here firstly larger companies have cheaper prices the first reason for this is that you have economies of scale i.e when you have more like fixed machinery etc and more established businesses producing an individual cost of a good becomes cheaper because you need to continually purchase new kinds of technology to be able to do so but secondly as a large company you're able to engage in cross-subsidization i.e if one portion of your company is doing poorly you can just fund other parts of your company that prevents the economic necessity of price hiking to help the bottom line of your own company which is really beneficial in allowing consumers to be able to access more affordable goods secondly size is important when it comes to things like networking effects what makes social media and technology companies so valuable for consumers is the large quantity of people who are able to opt into these shared systems to opt into the same network that allows you to perform something valuable business and social connections thirdly and this is really crucial size is really important for innovation the larger the company that you are the more likely that you're going to be to innovate for two reasons the first thing to say is that a larger capital buffer that comes from size allows you to take a greater quantity of risks this is because innovation is a risky endeavor because you're unsure if investing in a product is going to have a guaranteed return end of the day and therefore if you have a pool of money to fall back on as opposed to a newer startup your cost benefit analysis will shift in favor of that riskier choice for example google has a specific part of their businesses called moon shoot you're literally using for speculative ventures like self-driving cars that is exclusive to having a capital reserve but secondly you just need a lot of money to invest in innovation r d is really really expensive because it often involves a lot of experimentation hiring experts within their fields smaller companies simply lack the capital to be able to do that successfully the fourth reason that breaking up these companies is bad is that the process itself is very economically disruptive this is because there's going to be an immediate hit to like the share price of your company when you literally announce that it's being broken up and crucially there's often a lot of economic interconnectedness between individual companies and other sectors of the economy especially when they're large because you often have like pension funds might have bought bonds in those companies or just individual consumers who are not going to lose a large quantity of money the final mechanism here is that breaking up banks is something that is uniquely harmful and know that banks exist under their mechanisms because they often have large quantities of lobbying power and do pay politicians you need to have large banks because you greater the size that you have the greater the pool of money the larger just like the economic baseline that you have as a bank this is important because the more money that you have as a bank the more people that you're able to lend to you have the kind of capital reserve so this is possible for you and you're willing to get regulatory approval if you can show regulators i have this pool of capital to fall back on this is really important because when you extend capital to a greater number of people it allows them to use that money to help their own quality of life what then is the weighing of like all the mechanisms that i've just told you against the best case gov scenario benefiting the democratic process a couple things firstly large quantities of people are impacted by all the mechanisms that i spoke about literally every single person in society interacts with company everyone benefits from lower prices basically everyone uses some form of social media everyone benefits from products that come from innovation as opposed to a very few subset of people who actually vote and engage in the democratic process but secondly access to capital is a vital precursor of agency there's no intrinsic value of democracy when it does not produce outcomes i think it's far more important that we get the kind of outcomes that people actually fight for in democratic systems like better medical treatments from innovation like affordable goods second claim why is this process going to be highly politicized due to ambiguous criteria politicians can use this for highly politicized goals why is this standard so vague firstly it is merely about a threat rather than a demonstrated harm literally anything theoretically could be a threat to the democratic process there's nothing tangible to extrapolate from that but it's very easy for governments to just like invent justifications about how this could theoretically pose a threat to the process checks and balances can't work because in terms of courts they're often politicized as well we have politicians who like appoint people to the courts and therefore they'll be holding to political objectives in terms of voters you can't monitor like every single political case of these companies being broken up what then are the impacts of like some political influence of this firstly you re-embed the dominance of certain companies if the prop case is true that companies like apple have large quantities of political influence companies like apple who may improp best-case scenario have some political capture are simply going to just use this to shut down their own corporate rivals to break them up to consolidate their own power when they just exacerbate all of the problems of extreme market consolidation secondly this is a direct way of targeting political foes and political rivals people like bloomberg who own large media companies who competing politicians like trump are able to shut down those companies you make electoral processes less competitive when you decrease the wealth of the opposition but you also create an incentive for people to back down when you can use shutting down their corporation as a threat for all these reasons i'm very proud to stand in opening opposition i thank the speaker i now welcome deputy prime minister um yeah i guess just type bis in the chat and then i'll just okay you assume my mic is okay madam speaker it is terrifying to live in a world where there's more than 25 companies that have more profit on the gdp of entire countries these are companies that have not just the capacity to influence your choice in regards to what product you buy or what clothes you put on your body these are companies that have the capacity to influence the marketplace of ideas of every choice that you make in your life the role of opening opposition wasn't to stand up here and say oh you might break up random company that's kind of big what's to tell us why these enormous companies that have insane amounts of market monopoly that have insane capacity to literally guarantee an election solely based on whether or not they offer you their money and their electoral support should continue to exist as they are we think that the metric that we gave you for the companies we're breaking up is extremely high extremely clear we don't think they explain the harm of why these companies should continue to exist two things that i'm going to be talking about firstly about why we think that this is necessary and second why do you think this protects consumers and the democratic process overall before that i want to make two points on the mechanism passing on the countermec that the opposition gave us on this whole ah we're going to use magic fiat to use campaign finance legislation i think that and this is sort of like one of the pet peeves that i have with you today fiat is not a magic power and the problem with the opposition is that the very thing that we're telling you is a problem is the thing that is going to prevent them from exercising this magic amount of fiat because when companies go oh you are suddenly attempting to to pass this like huge huge regulation that is not going to allow me to lobby anymore they're obviously going to oppose it and precisely because of the mechanisms that we tell you that they have the capacity to lobby politicians to say no we're actually not okay with this those are the resources that are going to throw at you that's precisely the reason why on the opposition they're incapable of passing the things that are necessary that's when we tell you on opening government that if you want to control them you first have to threaten to break them up or break them up completely we don't think that they're pre-applied in this base the second thing that i want to point out in regards to the mechanism is that the metric that tudor gave you is actually an incredibly high bar think about what he told you he told you that these are companies that in order to manipulate or to post a value a valid threat to the democratic forces they have almost complete control of the market which means that they're able to engage in a race to the bottom to avoid regulation that they have so much money that they have the capacity to essentially guarantee an entire race when they propose to fund a particular candidate but also they have maybe like a crazy ceo that decides to play electoral poker with whether or not facebook actually influences your election choices i think these are unique things that mean that very few companies actually need this threshold i think that this means that it is a really really high bar but opening opposition has to show us and what i don't think they have shown so far is why we should tolerate the first trailer on the history of the earth to continue to exist as they are unchecked when they deliberately mess with the democratic process and with consumers choices we don't think they have done that first then why is this necessary i think that overall and also i want to address why specifically there has to be antitrust laws is because antitrust laws are going to protect consumers from predatory business practices so they can freely exercise choice and engage in a marketplace of ideas that works the problem madam speaker is that the capacity of companies to influence that choice has massively changed because of the internet and globalization they have enabled themselves to grow to an enormous extent and to a level of wealth that just was not possible to conceptualize before the last century but i think that more importantly is that they have now become literally impossible to control that right because of the things that twitter told you how they engage in races to the bottom where they're the only person the only companies that can allow you a viable way to live in your town when they oppose regulation and they have so much money that they can get that essentially not like siding with them on the lobby but only on the lobby ballot means guaranteeing your party a death sentence in the election when they have huge lawyer firms that they can engage to outcompete any other when they have the capacity to for example lower their prices for a while to kill all competitors and then suddenly hike them up and then you no longer have the capacity to engage well as a consumer but also that means that again all of the other mechanisms to their gave you kick in they become richer they have more capacity to lobby what does that translate into i think it translates into two big hounds for consumers especially in regards to the products opening opposition says ah yes but now products are going to be cheaper i think that that's sort of like okay yeah when amazon has to compete with other people they have an incentive to reduce their prices and become cheaper once they have almost a complete monopoly which is basically what they have right now i don't know if the amazon product i bought yesterday was actually cheaper than the real one because i didn't  look because there's no other website that you can actually buy in the problem is when they have a monopoly that's when they remove your choice entirely but more importantly once they have that monopoly it is when they have the capacity to sort of like completely remove your democratic pro your democratic choice because that's when they have enough money to start lobbying uh for other to start lobbying in regards to you making kinds of bad choices what are these bad choices it is voting for politicians that are actively against regulating exactly this sort of monopolies which creates an enormous terrible vicious cycle that allows them to gain more and more profit it looks like voting for politicians that again are very against taxing the rich i think that jeff bezos should maybe donate some of his trillions of books to children that are starving in africa but he won't because you know he's not forced to buy taxation because they keep voting republicans in who suspiciously are also mostly funded by his own company i think that that's problematic and i think that that only kicks in once these companies are as powerful as sugar tells you i think that our mechanism is very clear and very cleanly addresses why we think that this is going to fix it before i move on to my second question ceo actually uh you make it look like jeff bezos is some republican chill actually he mostly donates to democrats and owns a very prominent liberal newspaper how do you explain that i think he also owns some republican newspaper which i recently learned in a euros debate but the point is that they like diversify their interests so that they guarantee that whichever party wins is going to be a party that has to side with them so it doesn't matter if the democrats win in november because what jeff basis is going to do is going to be like hey joe biden remember when i financed your entire campaign you need to give me something now you need to you know lower company regulations for amazon which is historically what the democrats have also kind of done so yeah unclear they have enough money to play both sides we think that's damaging second why does this protect consumers uh four reasons i think firstly size that's why they can do this because they're enormous second because of competition monopoly opening up says ah but different companies can also act some monopoly but if i am a company i can benefit from having better regulatory standards than this other one so maybe i want to post government regulation because i am pro regulation because that gives me a competitive advantage that doesn't happen when there's only one company we don't think that mechanism works three because the mere existence of this laws is a threat the fact is that facebook only around with elections because they were allowed to because there was no existing regulations that would now the facebook stock owners are gonna look at this and be like look if you do this we're gonna get broken up and our money is gonna get caught in like a third of what we currently earn you're not allowed to do that so no more weird experiments for facebook and cambridge analytica um we think that actually investors prefer to not milk a company for profit for three years because that's very unstable and rather to stay with a steady profit that also doesn't meddle with elections the fourth reason that i have is that this actually makes them more pro regulation because if you have regulation on you that means that you're able from risk because countries cannot prosecute you because you're following regulations to follow democracy i think that at the end of the day this means that we are better capacity to regulate companies that otherwise we don't have the capacity to control they have more money than us they have more power than us this is the only way to control them i think the speaker i now welcome deputy leader of opposition i prefer verbal pois by the way so just send me uh or just say something okay great before i get into the meat of the speech i just want to start off with some characterization because i think the opening government team was a bit disingenuous about the size and scale of these companies let's be clear companies like apple have approximately 40 to 50 percent of the market share in north america and foreign phone companies have taken up a large percentage of that market share it is not the case that these are sold bodies where there's no other competition and the reason why you know this is true is because they don't meet the consumer welfare standard yet if it was the case that they were a true monopoly with 80 to 90 percent of market share they would already be engaging in monopolistic practices like jacking up prices so their characterization cannot stand in this debate given the fact that it has not reached that threshold yet so that is important because it means that there is still competition within many of these markets although there are all gabolistic tendencies in some circumstances obviously i'm going to talk about three things first i want to talk about whether or not this fixes the problem second i want to talk about welfare and individuals and the economic well-being of people and lastly i want to talk about this being used as a tool of political manipulation let's start on whether or not this fixes the problem and to begin with i just want to be clear with why our counter prop exists in this debate the government argument here is that there's going to be backlash if you try and push for regulations you're going to lawyer up for instance and have class action lawsuits amira i think that's going to happen when you break up the companies too to be completely honest if you think it is going to massively harm your company you're going to engage in that sort of lobbying against any sort of breakup so that part is symmetric given the fact that you're able to overcome the lobbying in the instance that we have a breakup i suspect that we can do so when we provide modest regulations in this debate and so given that fact that those regulations do stand now obviously the proposition bench might say well look the problem is that in the long term this company will get big enough that they can influence the political process so we need to stop them now in order to prevent future harms but note our regulations prevent those future harms from ever occurring because they never live no longer have a political pathway to influencing politicians the fact that for instance their campaign finance limitations no thank you or limitations on the amount of news that you can find that you can use fact checkers so that means that that harm is non-existent but let's be charitable let's say that they are able to get some of these harms let's talk about each of the individual harms and explain why they do not work first on the issue of lobbying what we established on the opening opposition from naomi and what was not adequately responded to is the fact that you have cartels which form even if you break up a large social media company into its constituent bodies all the individual social media companies like instagram facebook wechat etc will come together and lobby joe biden with their collective money anyways this is what large organizations like opec functionally do where large conglomerations of different companies can coalesce on single issues so you already get lobbying on either side of the house the question is does concentration make it worse and what we did not get an answer about was that from our opening government but on the flip side we actually flipped this argument because they waste their political capital on an ineffective solution but we provide campaign finance limitations which fixes the problem the second thing that they tell you is that there's a race to the bottom that these are large employers who are going to control a single city and therefore dictate labor regulations two responses first we can see that this makes some regulations harder harder but we think that there are countervailing incentives to exist for instance there's strong reason to believe in most cases there's still other employees within the city and therefore you're still going to have competition to get employees because you as employers want to treat someone decently in order to get them into your company as a whole the second response that i do want to point out is that this just isn't specific to the motion this justifies breaking up a big walmart in a small town when they are the sole employer so this is not a specific mechanism to dealing with that problem i think at the very best it incidentally deals with it in a very narrow and limited set of cases the third thing that they talk about is fake news and size war response on this issue is that on either side of the house fake news will exist on social media platforms the question is this what side is better the one with more resources are less we posit that when facebook has more resources they're able to have more rigorous fact checking and more administrators so even if they're fake news on either side of the house we think that we get a marginal win by being able to impose regulations and giving individual companies the ability to have actual funds to deal with it finally on the question of deterrence i just think they don't understand how most shareholders work they do not hold shares for a long period of time many people who hold shares are just normal pension funders or institutional investors or the average mom and pop like you and me and they only host hold those shares for quarters or a year at max that means that these time periods are not substantially long enough to create a long run incentive to prevent you from growing too large as a company and that's why companies grow too large in the status quo because shareholders have short-term incentives they don't actually analyze the details as to what shareholders think i think we've demonstrated that this policy does not fix the problems that they noted but i think we've actually flipped the argument and proven positive benefits on our side of the house on welfare i think that we gave lots of analysis here so i'm going to deal with the glib responses we got from lucia before that go your best case scenario is you said campaign funding laws that companies can later attempt to undermine our mechanism stops them from ever trying to do such a thing because that results in immediate uncertain laws but my question is how do they undermine it in the future if they can't donate more money to political campaigns they aren't going to be able to influence politicians who want to repeal the law so you need to demonstrate to us how your mechanisms political influence still occur even with our regulations that just wasn't done on welfare naomi tells you quite a great deal i think that there's a lot of it that still stands particularly given the fact that these are industries with modest amounts of competition meaning that the price reduction which comes from economies of scale also stands we also told you about networking effects and we told you about breaking up big banks now i want to reaffirm a mechanism that we provided about capital buffers we already established that these are deeply profitable companies that get lots of investment from shareholders but they're also companies that are large and stable enough to get large loans to fund these sorts of programs and that's why you get research into speculative programs and innovation in the long run now the claim that we get from their side of the house is that there are long-term harms that in the future you're going to have some kind of harm to consumers but in the future then when they have that demonstrated harm we just break them up when they hurt consumers and if their mechanism is on deterrence then we can co-opt the deterrence argument in terms of long-run economic effects because if they ever grow too large and start acting monopolistically then we break them up and that presumably has the deterrence effect that og wants so if deterrence is true then we certainly win on economics finally let's talk about fairness and all these sorts of issues in terms of whether or not this is going to be applied properly and the claim that comes from their side of the house is simply that there's a very limited set of companies in which you can do this but the definitions that you provide are quite vague you have to stick with the model that you provided and we gave you structural reasons as to why politicians will manipulate this kind of process so say that just a limited number of companies meet this criteria is incredibly big especially given the fact that companies like apple who you would presumably want to regulate have 40 to 50 market share how do you weigh this debate at the end we think that the economic benefits affect everyone and that people and democracies are relatively disengaged given the fact that they only vote 40 of the time so there's a revealed preference in favor of the economy as a consequence economic benefits are the most important and grant you autonomy in the rest of your life much as democracy grants autonomy over the political system proud to oppose thank you i thank the speaker not to start off closing half i invite my book government here can you hear me extensions from closing government firstly i'm going to talk about why the domination systematically influences the democratic decision what other sort of tech profit model or the business model that exists under social media which is systematically influencing democracy second why democratic threat can be the criteria for for breaking up and lastly why the criteria of democratic threat between itself incentivize the social media companies to change its changes a business model and to change its incentives throughout the sort of things that is happening within democracy so firstly we think that why democrat why domination systematically influences democratic decisions the main alternative we hear from opening opposition is that there could be things like citizens like criticism there could be things like external like intervention from these companies and self-regulation can happen but there are systematic reasons why social media companies may have no incentive to deny that to improve the existence of democratic threat between this company i.e things like misinformation or fake news industry that exists within social media companies the biggest reason is because they make money from just from the democrat from the democratic threat the other one who are contingent on this business model to make money and that's why these kind of things are happening what are the sort of things that we are talking about firstly algorithm model facebook makes 10 000 or 3000 dollars per month from this algorithm model the number of clicks that pay fake news get is important for these companies because they get money from by providing the platform technique that's why they want more people to click on the fake news and they want more people to click on the advertisement so that this social media company can make money from that but second they are actively doing filter field available and they are actively creating echo chamber this is precisely because they are able to by having more people click on the link by having more viewers for that for the website having more time looking at the looking at the fake news post for example these social media companies make this money that's why they are actively like actively like swaying these people to look at this advertisement by creating artificial filter bubble based on the preference and based on the browser data of these users that's why they in order to increase the number of clicks that they the users click or the number of in order to increase the advertisement revenues that this social media company gets they are actively creating this situation and they are actively creating echo chamber which reinforces the bias throughout the minority individual which which incentivizes people to think that donald trump is someone that they should vote for third of all foreign accounts countries like philippines facebook understand has technology to know that which looking at programs or like the past you pass like record of the users they know which which type which users is like which users is like spam accounts but they are not stepping in because they are getting money by having more number of users by having number of users click on the advertisement revenue we think this is harmful because a they are able to create artificial opinion on the illusion of objective objectivity to make people think that voting for this person or voting for the utility is something good but b this opinion shaper is able to send things like hate speech or destruct threatening individuals to both utility under philippines that's why for example duterte was able to create keyboard army or online fan base for like 12 million propaganda users and users to amplify the views uh amplify the view and then sway these voters to vote god for him facebook is not doing anything because precisely because they make money from the existence of this democratic threat but fourth first thing that the facebook does not engage through is things like cambridge and analytica information used to maximize on our campaign campaigning they were able to use this information to improve their campaign or improve their speech or for example chick stock is taking away private information and they have the potential ability to look at the ccp but they are not doing anything because they realize that all these kind of things happening but they make money and that's why they are not stepping in right now lastly manipulation of the touch engine for example facebook google was able to sway uh to have more favorable results for like hillary clinton with things that touch his own precisely because they want more people to make them precisely because they want to make money from that what is the implication of this the implication therefore is that self-regulation is systematically not happening under their side because they make money and this is based on the profit model and business model why is this something important and why it deserves to be broken up firstly we are talking about developing developing country context firstly this is important because there's global use across the globe in terms of social media but second especially these individuals are the ones who tend to become reliant on this social media company especially given the conventional media companies in this developing country seems to not be functioning that's why for example duterte was able to win elections despite the fact that he has things like terrible overpopulation within prison and this proportion and punishment for these people well that's why for example brazil boso is not the thing that probably 19 but he is able to gain popularity precisely because of the social media negligence a second impact is a minority we think this is the most important because this individual as a most vulnerable individual under their side of the heart trump is able to attack people like muslim a woman like abortion like precisely because if he is able to galvanize support by using the social media platform to attack these people and to gain support from these people using the echo chamber and this kind of thing is land force waiting outside even the social media company are the ones who profited at the expense of this minority and at the expense of this democratic party failure we think that social media legitimate to call the social media company pay for it pay for what it has done but last impact is democracy we think the ability to vote is something important based on your subjective priority and based on your interest given that this mess information will take news it's hindering these people's ability to vote on their more best way they think this is harmful firstly why why is this important firstly because we think the concept of corporate life is only based on instrumental value given that it's not helping the citizens on the ground we think we need to change this but second in terms of reciprocity only when you have a given that you pay tax or your lessons low for example we think that is only less than you when you are able to freely date both based on your democratic interests why is breaking up likely to change because because they don't want to be background they don't want to be broken up that's why they are likely to listen to she's this is freedom we allow a monday you need to do this abc we are able to conditionalize this company to follow these kind of laws uniquely everything outside of the house when we have this breakup as i criteria follow firstly because they have like the technological ability they're likely to do this but second because they want to avoid breakup for the first time they'll have incentives to intervene to things like like patriotic brewing using their unique know-how and the unique skills that they have we think that was the first time we are able to incentivize this company to change the incentive and to change the business model that they have right now for these reasons they are extremely proud of the proposed thank you all right i thank the speaker uh i now invite the opposition member okay so uh good evening everyone and welcome to what i'm sure is the universe's most spicy true point in recorded history um so this debate is not going to be won or lost based on benefits of monopolies maybe prices go up maybe prices go down the good arguments on both sides maybe if more innovation maybe there's less because i'm always this debate it's about whether or not democracy survives not just in nice demographics like they're kind of talking about like the us this debates about much bigger do we trust countries like singapore like indonesia like large swarms and south saharan africa with weak democratic institutions and a high potential of abuse do we trust these sorts of democracies the vast majority of democracy in the world to exercise these powers responsibly and not to abuse them and we think the risks are huge i want to go significantly beyond what the opening opposition gave you and talking about why all democracies both good and bad one strong and weak ones will be horrifically abused but the other thing i want to do is tell you why there are structural incentives apart from fear why is that regulation either self-regulation or from government is going to happen and we already see it happening so you do say scenario we see coming up from the opening government is simply false therefore why do you think it's actually easy in many instances to regulate large monopolies of disorder firstly because the big argument against regulation i.e that you push them that you push up industry out of business that you wreck people's livelihoods that you destroy smes does not apply to large multi-billion or trillion dollar companies this is why even republicans hate amazon and hate facebook and hate google which is why all three ceos were drilled in a bipartisan way just two weeks ago because the single biggest right-wing economic argument against regulation simply does not apply to them secondly we live in a broadly populist move now right it's basically very very unpopular to be seen in cahoots with any kind of controlling force whether that is i don't know the international jury if your conspiracy theory minor or just large corporations right no during the 2018 midterms in the us also the most right-wing developed country in the world candidates which did disproportionately well or those who publicly committed to receiving no donations whatsoever from super pacs or from corporations so there's natural political incentives suggesting that there's reasons for people not to accept this money which is why we hear from opening government that these things will just buy elections wholesale there's just no evidence for that if you look at the list of largest political donors none of the companies they listed are on the top it seems like the koch brothers or rupert murdoch who are actually responsible for the large donations in a very factual level california nevada arizona canada just passed regulations specifically directed at amazon's abusive practices towards its storehouse workers because it was massively popular on both sides of the art right so we again don't think this reality plays out thirdly we think especially for social networks your image is everything if you are seen as permitting fake news and conspiracy theories to spread you lose users in a massive way the best example is facebook facebook is facing a massive financial crisis because it's getting basically no users between the 16 to 25 demographic age and it's losing most of them to other platforms to more aggressive policing policies like instagram or twitter right which now puts out actual correction notices that is why facebook recently started putting um saying putting on videos of label which is reading the information in this video is false but we're not taking it down because it's the public interest to still see it right so the reality is for social companies for whom lobbying a politician is nowhere as important as actually attracting young new people onto your website which you can't do by showing them an ad on tv which young people don't watch their natural incentives against it lastly i just want to point out the facts of the world simply show this is not true think about all of the dubious democracies in the world which recently passed fake news laws and managed to arm twist many of these large social media companies into abiding by them right i simply do not think the characterization is accurate natural checks and balances which suggest that these problems are going to go over so what is the risk why is it that these things are so immensely dangerous and powers we should not give governments in the first place the reason is because the criteria they set up are big and i want to go significantly beyond the opening opposition explaining why the first criteria they say is we are going to break you up if you have enough lobbying power to buy an election the question is what exactly is enough because there is no way of measuring this you can never tell me which particular advertisement which a politician bought which was funded by which particular company was the one who helped him win the elections elections are complex and not multicausal and even decades after them with all the information we don't know who won for what reason the moment you give a weak democracy with a sclerotic government corrupt politicians weak judges and regulators appointed by the political powers that need the ability to decide if your opponents or the person you just ousted from power bought an election you are handing them a blank check with which to break up any media organization that tries to basically access check and balance and this is not hypothetical this is literally word for word what the philippines did to both the rappler as well as its largest tv broadcaster they broke them up on the basis that they had too much political influence when these two broadcasters were the ones criticizing duterte the most vociferous the reason why we prefer anti-trust regulation to focus on measurable things like are you raising prices are you putting in place barriers to entries and these things might be complicated yeah i grant you that but they are measurable and not as subject to plausible deniability and political manipulation in the way your criteria are similarly their talk about fake news which i think applies equally to what the closing government said as well right we think governments passing fake news laws with fines is generally kind of disturbing but we're okay with it because a fine does not devastate your company outright but when this power allows you to single-handedly destroy a company it's far more risky for a couple of reasons the most obvious one is that fake news is a politically contested concept and i'll take uh oh yeah would you yeah if you're a cool young company as you describe and then the mechanism doesn't really kick in because you're not tampering with elections however if you are like facebook and you experiment on voters it does that's a unique benefit whereas you get a non-unique arm given that they're affiliated anyways criteria are infinitely extendable so for instance you talk about buying elections what if they just buy a local election for a judge why if they buy a euro election what if they're maybe not a national monopoly but a local monopoly your criteria admit of no natural limit to how far you can extend these things right so even a local start-up with very good relations to one politician could eventually be caught under your policy this is a real risk right so for instance a sentence like donald trump is a sexual predator technically it's a false statement because no court has convicted him of actually being a sexual predator republicans hate bad people is technically fake news because that's never been empirically proven right this is a real problem and you allow countries to massively abuse this especially when it's the og themselves point out there's a deterrent effect to this right i'm not saying the standards call is perfect there will still be bubbles of the salt which ceo talks about will still be fake news the question is do we want to let governments decide wholesale with this obscene power what that means and undermine democracy and get rid of the criticism which we will never be able to solve we think we should not take this risk especially the natural mechanism for solving it that's why we're very very proud to stand uh in opposition all right um i thank the speaker i now welcome the government with here audio check my audible for clarification to let us win firstly on to the opening government it is true for ashish to point out that regulation is possible but it is only for the og scenario because the og pro from the og character like identified is this idea about lobbying and etc right but the problem toshiya identify is is clearly different from this we have told you how algorithm is particularly problematic or how this filter bubble is particularly problematic or how this incentive of the strategist is particularly important that is why we we choose this option of breaking up which is particularly different from og because what we want to do in the worst case of this breaking up is that we want to get rid of this particular and toxic algorithm and i think this is the only solution to which we can we can sustain the democracy that is why we particularly target this like a small small like a social media social media like platform but the second thing which distinct og enclosing government is that we are our argument is not contingent on the size of the company but we are as contingent on the nature of the company we are more than happy to intervene and break up those companies even if it is small if they have this toxic algorithm and we're more than happy to take away that particular market market brand or let's say this market branch for them to benefit because i if if that is if that is harming democracy i think they're clear justification that is why it is distinctly different from og and older bottles that may damage og but not closing government but the second thing we need to clarify is the reason why opening opposition is dying out because i think the main reason which way main which in possible way main which in which opening opposition are able to take this debate is by saying that ah breakup will actually happen and people are going to suffer firstly i don't think break up something likely to happen in the first place because company know that there is something that they can avoid by changing the algorithm etc i don't think those harm are likely to happen but secondly at the point in which you conceded the regulation is something they want to do the question i want to ask you is that what kind of regulation are you going to implement in what is the punishment for not not uh not following that regulation is it that some fine if it is fine i will say that it's not going to be effective example of soft bank in japan which is one of the biggest companies it is consecutively doing tax avoidance and it is going to be it's fine by the country again and again but still they do tax avoidance you know why it is because it's still profitable to do so that is why we need to break up and take away the branch of the branch of the profit that uh branch our branch of the uh of the business that they are doing in order to stop that profit mechanism to actually change the incentive structure of this company that is why opening opposition material also dies but finally why closing opposition dies in this debate is because look their argument is that this is going to be abused by some dubious democratic country the first thing you need to understand is that dubiously democratic country will  out democracy irregardless right as duterte did they're going to find a way possible to that like to make democracy most favorable on their in their own way i don't think the counterfacts will be no different at all but the second thing we need to understand is that the mechanism pusha provides you it's not gonna it's not gonna exist only in the united states but it can extend a developing country we told you how this algorithm is particularly damaging uh particularly damaging the democracy within developing countries and how does how it is like massively damaging the people on that ground we think this breaking up this particular mar uh brand in one country means that it is hard for for for apple or i mean facebook or twitter to to dilute democracy in those countries right because oftentimes headquarters in in one country and it is like it's not like smarter idea for you know for our for like twitter or facebook to have like you know many many branches which do the exact same business that is why being broken up means that that is hard for this company to continue to democracy all over the world the moment in which this moment is which this breakup happens in the united states means that the harmful developing country are also going to be stopped based on that two questions i want to ask you will we really end up breaking up this company but second even if it happens why our side is better so first simple question will we really need to end up breaking companies i think i have comprehensively answered this question at the beginning and pointing out why opening opposition lost this debate but in addition to that like uh there there's also a reason why we're gonna be very careful on the execution of this why because it is also the jury who knows that the extent of the impact of breaking up google or let's say facebook twitter they're gonna be very careful on doing so because they also want to avoid you know societal criticisms if you're especially talking about supreme court it is that the society has a scrutiny over who are going to be the next you know the judge in the supreme court that is why they are very sensitive to what the people are going to say that's why they're going to be very careful with that but secondly uh opening opposition said that court is politicized that is bad but i will challenge this premise right look at the example of donald trump having a muslim ban what have happened is that the supreme court like stopped this you know like as president order and said that muslim ban is actually bad and bad and unconstitutional in those instances i don't think court is that bad as what their side of the house is saying that's why i don't think it's likely that the case um no not not yet so second moving on to the second question even if it happens why is less important so dealing with what opening options said they firstly said ah you're gonna have a cheap product but number one like i think it's gonna be still cheap anyways because competition still go goes on you can go to twitter and facebook it's banned and you can go to let's say wechat and twitter is bad but secondly even if it got expensive to what extent it's going to be expensive right never illustrate it by opening opposition it may be a bit expensive but what is the harm of that right but second thing they talked about the people connection go to other sources right thirdly they talked about are there going to be more innovation in in these big companies that's why it's going to be a loss i would say number one the reason why you know this big tech company has more more innovation in the status quo is not necessarily because they can take the risk because startups can also take their risk because their money is not theirs what is the investors money right it's not they can't take takers anyway but the thing is startup is suppressed by making a innovation in the first place precisely because of the existence of these big tech companies so even if we assume the best case server for opening opposition i don't think any of the harm that they're talking about is going to be realistic at the end of the day next week then why do you why you should buy closing government analysis several reasons number one because of the uh because of the existence of alternative as i have told you there are a bunch of alternatives to the harm that opposition talk about precisely because of the existence of competition if apple is bad you can go to samsung and i don't think that they're going to be a significant difference in the quality of their product but secondly the reason why you should buy us is the reversibility of the harm note that if even if one big company are gonna be breaking up which by the way we're not gonna let them bankrupt we're just taking away one toxic like business branch to avoid the dilation of democracy right but even if that is the case right reversibility of your heart so what we have proven to you is that you can't although you can like switch to other companies the harmony illustrated you is immense in philippine billions of people are literally dying because democracy is taken away but also in brazil because of this dilution of democracy people don't know how bad their own prime minister is and resulting in having many corona buyers and people dying is literally irreversible form of harm on the other hand even if we ban big companies they're going to be other companies right these horns are something reversible at the end of the day but finally in terms of responsibility it is the responsibility of this big company that people need to die because of the they lose democracy people literally die to fight for democracy for all that reason they have responsibility to secure that for all that reason i'm very proud to win this debate i thank the speaker i now welcome the final speaker opposition hello i'm just testing um can you hear me yeah it's a bit wrong but i can hear right a bit softer like robotic like stuff like static ish maybe that's just a voice here i don't want to stress me i'm not getting the connection okay right i want to firstly deal with fiji because i think they're largely out of this debate cg's entire premise relies upon this weird mechanism that suggests that we can change the profit incentives of companies by making them more friendly to democracies because now they are afraid of getting broken up this flies against all of the analysis that comes from the opening government because the entire point of the opening government's case was to suggest that we need to be preemptive such that these companies don't grow large enough to actually serve as a threat when it comes from the coffers that they are able to then generate in terms of fighting for political lobbying or whether it comes to them becoming the only alternative such that it becomes more difficult for us to impose regulations upon them which means that the closing government uh model or mechanism is by far the least realistic one in this entire debate and therefore all the other arguments are just generic criticisms of why potentially social media outlets right now are not regulated enough not actually an argument as to why we need to change anti-trust laws to deal with these kinds of companies so what exactly do we think that we provided in this debate that takes us above the opening exchange i think the opening relies upon one unique mechanism and that mechanism is the notion that democratic governments right now have a strong interest and incentive as well as an ability to ensure that the democratic consolidation and process is well protected first of all we suggested to you that the vast majority of democracies in the world don't actually have states that care deeply about these kinds of outcomes but rather have states that seek to weaponize regulations in a way they empower their own bases but secondly i would like to point that this also applies to the vast majority of western democracies in today's society as well do they understand to which the eroding guard rails of the institutional protections of democracy this means that people like trump for instance have a unique and similar symmetrical incentive to ensure that these kinds of companies at the point in which they go against them can now be shut down as well what is the unique delta in this debate then we think that the difference between the notion of anti-trust laws and regulations against these kinds of companies or regulations against the opposition is the notion of what public sentiment is like so in status quo even if you have a lot of money when it comes to political funding what the government bench and i think to understand the opposition bench misses out it's not just that the quantity remains the same but rather that no matter how much money you have that money is less important than public sentiment when it comes to how people turn up at the ballot box this therefore means that even if you can get billions of dollars from one particular company if that company is sufficiently unpopular or if the public sentiment is sufficiently against that company no amount of money from that company is going to be strong enough to move politicians towards shutting that company uh towards um like supporting that company expense of the individuals who are on the ground but why is this different in this particular scenario look when you have an abusive government the abusive government is very unlikely to clap down on companies that are against them outright reason for this is because even in weak democracies around the world there is a strong amount of public support for democracies as a whole look at countries like malaysia like singapore for example even the united states they care about the philippines as well they care about democracy as a fundamental concept in theory and often rail against governments and perceived attempts of shutting these uh like oppositional voices down the problem in this case is that the method of anti-trust laws is one that is uniquely capable of providing these forms of regimes a way of shielding and providing them plausible deniability against the excesses of power that don't exist in other scenarios so what happens now is that while there is negative public sentiment that allows us to for example curtail the powers of facebook or curtail the powers of like other bigger corporations foreign what happens is nicely in order to consolidate your own ability to create authoritarian backslides such that you tell the public we are dealing with the big bogeyman when in actual fact what you are doing is fighting and using these laws selectively on certain companies they are not currently support position we think that's incredibly problematic but we say that these kinds of companies are often also the ones or these monopolies are often also the ones that actually help up the democratic process is supposed to hurt it first of all presumably given that the intermediary teams in the opening rely on is the state and state is not exactly a uh uh uh intermediary that can be trusted at least to send to which like anti-trust laws can be easily weaponized then we think that they already failed to show a proper mechanism as to how exactly this occurs but secondarily companies like facebook for example actually act as a strong check against presumably like more authoritarian and problematic governments in countries like the philippines etc the reason for this is because these companies have a sufficient amount of capital to be able to stand up against uh like fines or sanctions that are levied against them because they can weaponize the idea that the government is fighting against them for instance but secondarily i would suggest that um on top of that there is also a few reasons why monopolistic companies are better for democracy as well so the first thing being that if they can like the stuff that ashley gave you about structural reasons why they have an incentive to self-regulate when it comes to garnering that same public sentiment that attempts to fight for democracy on the ground so you use that same theoretical desire for democracy that even weak democracies have in order to push this monopolistic company towards using the largest for good and greater democratic aid but secondly suggests that the idea of a monopoly versus multiple small intermediaries is presumably a lot easier to regulate as well but before i move on i'll take one from og presumably you're still happy with regulating you know the spread of fake news isn't it then the same and why is it that you can like regulate fake news on the philippines won't abuse it but they will definitely abuse this one specific mechanism that is for some reason on exclusive right because the notion of antitrust law is very very different in that the notion of fake news is already a politicized concept something that actually surely talked about the difference is the notion of anti-trust law is uniquely different in that you use economic arguments but also existing suspicion of these big giant conglomerations in order to try and create plausible deniability for the for the kind of sneaky that you are doing against this thing okay i just lost the ability to say that in a more sophisticated manner but next the reason and the reason for example interrogation of these big companies in front of congress in the u.s for example is a great example of how big monopolistic corporations are actually far more better held to pass than small intermediaries look all of the problems that the og and the oro want to talk about presumably exist on either side the difference is when you're talking about specific monopoly and what you are able to therefore do is that even if these monopolies are doing kind of weird stuff the first thing to note is that you can target the regulations against one specific corporation that also has the ability to fend all these regulations this doesn't exist but you're talking about medium or smaller size enterprises that people would then say are going to be staffed out by the government you are far more able to scrutinize bigger companies and impose these regulations upon them because both sides recognize that these companies can survive through that as a result we would suggest that in the best case scenario they act as a bulldog against authoritarianism but secondly in the worst case now you can better regulate them the crucial thing to note however is that the differentiating factor here is what the democracy could potentially exploit this particular castle to do to these um to these companies which we think is something that is problematic all right i thank the speaker uh i thank everyone um you guys may head back to the main zoom room while the judges stay here and deliberate thank you thank you
