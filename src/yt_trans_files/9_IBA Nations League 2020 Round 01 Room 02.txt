Transcript:
 offenses under their religion as long as they remain members of that religion we welcome the prime minister to open this debate can you hear me yes okay three arguments from prime minister firstly why this form of community-based justice is principally justifying the prospect irrespective of the consequence second why more fair version of justice is possible within outside when we let this community decide by themselves we think that as an alternative or the counter-fracture which is likely within their side is what their private punishment or vigilantism is likely to be more radicalized and likely to be less accountable with the outside we think letting these people have have control over their justice is going to be much more accountable mechanism for these people before that what what what do we stand for within the speech firstly we think we are talking about the situation in which criminal both the criminal and victim whole sentences join this religious code this means that if either victim or the criminal does not consent to joining this community or joining this religious code we think this debate that we think that we don't have legitimacy to punish these people we think this debate happens only in the context in which both both actors consented to joining this religious court second we think it is likely to be based on the consensus of the community we think there's going to be like different like trial process there's going to be different precedence like lydian laws for example so that there is going to be accountable as as much as possible we already see this in example of like ace of indonesia we think we are able to have a countable mechanism waiting outside of the house third of all we think we are talking about religiously unsacred actions such as killing animals such as going against the religious practice and going against the religion we think that's the sort of things that we are talking about within this motion before moving on to my arguments yes or oh um so just as do clarification so will state legislation still apply and on top of what these courts already do and second of all um will you also be prosecuting presumably for uh for crimes against the religion so attacking a tenant of that religion and not respecting it you'll prosecute for that i assume as well uh no that's not our stance we think that this religious court is something that only exists so those people who consented to joining in this community and opting out of the state secular court so firstly why this is principally justified firstly we think this is justified because it is based on the consent on both criminals and the victims and the community we think it is about the autonomy of these individuals to actualize their sacred property in a way in which they prefer especially given the religion is a subjective value a morally contentious value which which is not which is unspeculatively valuable for these people we think some for some people this is so important to the identity we think this is not something that should be denied and given the death content we think that we should not deny these people access to this code second we think that definition of justice is something that is subjective and arbitrary in the first place we think it is something that is arbitrary and morally contentious in the first place but although it is obviously we have criminal justice because it is based on the society consensus and community consensus and this is why we have there we think this is why we believe it's estimated for this community to have their own form of criminal justice there are all forms of small government to have their own criminal justice system we think that even though given that there's no absolute justice we think that it's legitimate for these people to have this we think understated when on the outside we are able to have a community level of justice in the same way under democracy we decide what kind of punishment is legitimate based on election and referendum on the same way we think the community deserves the right to this subjectively determine what kind of community that they want but some reason is reciprocity we can criminal justice system is something that is called positive institution an entity it literally violates your life for example taking away your money or for example your lightsaber likes the mobility to put in the jail all of these kind of thing is taken away from these people we think this kind of infringement of life is something that is only justified when they when you have consent and when you feel that your justice is something that is representing your core identity but last reason is because this community has been influenced their sovereignty this community has has been caused into joining the state because of the political violence they were they were caused into joining the state joining the state things like indigenous communities or things like religious minority they didn't want to join this community but because this community was invaded they are sovereignty we think that at least we should give lethality give these people a justice based on the on on their subjective way of justice and we think that's a principle like that access to these people irrespective of the consequence second argument why our vagina is going to be a better mechanism firstly let's clarify why in their side of the house it is likely to be unaccountable and vigilantism is likely to occur within meeting in the first place the reason why we have law in the first place is firstly to punish these people but secondly to prevent prevent private judgment or to prevent social chaos that's why we think this point is going to be important why in their side people are likely to be unsatisfied three reasons firstly you don't trust the secular government they feel that their score identity and their religion is denied by the society and denying by the state and you feel that you feel that that court system is something unless time that's why people will not opt in or will not cooperate the justice in their side of the house in the first place but second they feel the sense of lack of justice they feel that they are unsatisfied they feel that their their voice is not represented that's why in order to compensate or in order to fulfill in that gap and the anger they are likely to opt into private judgement private judgement or like vigilantism but about this individual ally is radicalized because they feel that they are they feel emotionally emotionally angry that these people's voices are only presented and given that the people who will be making making vigilantism within their side is not accountable at all we think that this is likely to be far worse mechanism within their side of the house we think this is important because it is likely to lead to over-punishment and we think punishment is only estimated when there's a fair proportionate return based on the consensus of the society we think this is likely to be lost under vigilantism and things like exclusion from the community things like killing this individual for going for killing animals is this kind of like purpose punishment is more likely to happen within their side of house why waiting outside of the house the account this this judgment is likely to be more accountable firstly we will have rulebook or accountability we think that if there's likely to be different processes like trial or judges or written laws in order to prevent like the mispunishment or the like overpunishment of these people but second there's likely to be public school scrutiny people will criticize for the action that they see they when they feel that community is over or very proper disproportionately punishing these people they are likely to criticize that's why that's why we think that there's enough mechanisms to get us to cater to the different needs of the individual within outside of the house assertable people are likely to accept it because the perception of the people is this justice was done by the legitimate legitimate process of our community our religion that's why because it is done by the authority of the religious community they are likely to trust it compared to the secular government that's why people will likely accept the results and we think the more organic and more moderate type of change is more likely to happen with the outside even though in the worst case we are like lgbtq individual may be punished we think that these people like criticize when they are punishing to the disproportionate extent that's why for example on your status quo when they when they stop the punishment when that uh mentally ill this kind of suffering balance mechanism can uniquely happen outside for these reasons we are extremely proud to propose thank you we now welcome the leader of opposition to begin their speech okay can everyone hear me yep sorry one second sorry you just had to stop an alarm which was ringing in the house so okay uh everyone's ready let's start in three two one panel there's a few clarifications to be made before uh we get into my constructive points and then four main uh points from leader of opposition which contain um an integrated rebuttal as well so first of all let's request clarification note that i think a lot of the rhetoric coming from open government is around this notion of the community deciding and this beautiful sort of democratic spirit that these courts will have this is absolutely a delusion the reason for this is because this community will have no ability or minimal ability to have any say over what these laws look like or how they're applied the reason for that is obviously because these are religious sports that means that the scriptures are the ones which decide what the religious laws are the scriptures which are very unchangeable and are very holy in their construction of religious texts or or alternatively it's just leaders who decide and decide what the word of god is rather than you know lay people within that particular community right that not only has harms for for the people within the community but it will also tell you how that makes the community far harder to change and community input to be taken far far less into account so jumping straight into our constructive points and um we and within them uh rebuttal is integrated so first of all i want to point out that there is are substantial harms which agree upon individuals uh if you allow these kinds of religious courts within democracy harms which they cannot avoid because they are um because they have very little choice over whether they are part of this religion or not the reason for that is simple because all these well the overwhelming majority of religious individuals around the world are born into their religion they have no choice at the point of their birth what family they're born in what religious what religion that family has and indoctrinates them then throughout their childhood deals in years in ways that they cannot avoid uh to be to be integrated within that religion that means that these people have no choice as regards to ever choosing to opt into the system of courts no opening government portrays it as if it's a form right there's no you know there's no way of petitioning to be part of this uh community and then you know uh adhering to its guidelines and then signing the contract no it's you that you're born into it or your family indoctrinates you the overwhelming majority of instances that means that you're substantially exposed to harms with no ability to control them what are those harms their harms upon women right and which in many instances will be denied their independence because their husband is suing them and forcing them to stay in an abusive marriage just because he can under these religious laws and religious courts will agree with them it's harms to individuals who discover that they're lgbtq and are harmed and you know have judgments and punishments applied upon them because a member of the community decided that they're going to sue them because they're against the public morality and they're offended and then the court strikes down their rights takes away their rights secludes them into their houses doesn't allow them to go to uh institutes of education and so on it's again girls who want to go to university right but then their family says no you can do that and then someone else from the community sues them if they try to leave the community to go to university because it's against the moors right similarly about respecting real just holidays you know eating whatever you like and so on this is substantially harmful for these lives and restricts the choices these people have on their lives when i additionally point out that often you know that that's that means that there's a double burden that these people face right the state system which they still have to respect in terms of criminal justice and so on but also this religious uh system which also harms them additionally right comparatively it's far easier to for example contest a state system and democ a democratic system in which laws are applied to you compared to this um the scenario of religious wars the reason for that is because in the democracy you can and for the state systems you can campaign against those those laws or persuade people or petition people or are you have the ability to coalize with other people who have the same problem as you and sort of rebel to some degree um to some degree against that if you know government tells us oh but states are are similarly oppressive you have none of that ability in a scenario where scriptures are fixed the word of god comes from the religious leaders there is no ability to contest that and you have to stick to those hearts now the second thing i want to point out in terms of constructivism is this kind of system has a very powerful lock-in mechanism right the reason is is because because it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy the motion does say the laws of this these religions courts will only apply to you as long as you're part of that religion but if the acts of revolt against that religion which may lead you to leave the religion if those acts of revolt initial act of revolt are crushed down with actual punishment upon you then there is no genuine ability for you to leave that religion right because if you're suffering punishment from these courts as soon as you start rebelling right by the time you'll never get to the moment to the final moment on the spectrum of saying i've had enough of this religion right i want to leave because at the first act of revolution you'll be struck down harmed and disturbed actual uh our harms will be imposed on you upon face uh by these religions right already it's hard to leave this religion because of self-hate because of catholic guilt you choose it right but beyond the fact that now you're suffering inside that means you you also can be because there's actual constraints upon you imposed upon you as well i want to point out on a more macro level this lock-in mechanisms mean lock-in mechanism means moderates and progressives can never split away from their religion right or inform another sector a more progressive version of that religion at all now i also want to point out that first of all in in terms of our first substantive as regards the progression and evolution of this religion we tell you the evolution is substantially slowed down by this the existence of these courts because now when you get reformists within a religion you you you are able to you know you when you get reformists who go against this religion and sort of contest its leaders what you get from the leaders is some pushback but it's oral pushback it's persuasive pushback right but nonetheless the claims of the reform must often stick and throughout the ages right mean that the religion is it does evolve look at the catholic church and after coming after massive sort of um you know criticism after all throughout the last centuries it has substantially evolved through pope francis and so on the reason being that they can't avoid that criticism anymore that's not the case if you can crack down on that criticism from the beginning and if you can crack down and finance that criticism by actual laws which punish people for any kind of criticism or going against that religion so reformism is taken down substantially i also want to point out that previously religious leaders needed to listen to the community opinion because the community opinion was their only mandate the credence of the community was the only mandate right and they had to adapt to the shifting tide of public opinion now legal prescriptive force gives them a source of authority unrelated to the community opinion at all so they are not forced to evolve whatsoever they get a force of authority which is uncontestable whatsoever it has the power of law the fourth point i want to make is that minority communities in western countries are now substantially harmed because if they choose to go down this route the perception of them will be massively negative right rather than being part of the tapestry of diversity and but share the common values of being french or being english even if you're from the middle east they will now be demonized and marginalized because the far-right groups right from marine le pen to whatever boris johnson will say they're uninterested in taking up our values they refuse state systems they have their own courts and thus we have to marginalize them they're not part of our citizenry this also happens even if you disassociate from the religion right and even if you disassociate the value of courts will be imposed upon you and you'll be demonized for those reasons and thus will not be able to meaningfully integrate whatsoever because you're seen as buying into entirely separate systems unrelated to state systems of equality thank you thank you we now welcome the deputy prime minister hello audio check can you hear me um the concept of justice in saudi arabia and united states is greatly different however united states never intervened and say this is the form of the justice that you need to subscribe to which is what my prime minister have clearly clearly told you which oh choose to neglect the principle that we have told you is that as long as this community set at their own form of justice it should be principally justifiable at that moment i think deputy leader of opposition need to tell us why just because this community exists in democracy means that this democracy has a justification to intervene and say this is our justice you should subscribe to it as long as oh don't do that i think it's og clearly taking over irregardless of the practical consequences but moreover i don't think leader of the opposition again engaged with the most most vulnerable actor in today's debate that is to say the person who will be who will be over punished or in the worst case going to be murdered by this private punishment that we but that my partner have told you we think the existence of this court will allow more accountable mechanisms compared to the world in which we don't have this court in the first place i.e private punishment will lead to murder and i think that's more dramatic in order to visualize the harm which does exist in the status quo we again think this court is necessary to protect a vulnerable individual based on that i like to ask you two questions one is it justifiable for democracy to force their own concept of justice into this community which is an entirely principled point secondly which gives comparatively acceptable consequence because we're not going to be saying by og that we're going to we're going to be able to have a utopia but i think opposition world lives in a dystopia comparatively to og we think that is why uh we're going to be answering this question and tell you why people suffer more before that clarifications not so so that this debate won't be messed up so firstly like with in for example when a non-religious person were offended by a religious person i think this was the poi from the oro to my prime minister just to be clear like in case for example united states citizens committed crime in saudi arabia i think there's an international treaty to decide which law to subscribe in those particular like instance case by case right i think it's the same should apply there i think the main contention of today's debate is that within this religious community if the criminal and the victim are like are registered as a believer in this religion how should we punish these acts for example if a person kill a cow in india for example i think that hinduism are going to prosecute this individual in that instance i i think these are the instances we are mainly talking about in today's debate so given that hinduism individual killing like cow i think that's when this person may face a sanction but secondly given this nature of the motion i think it is pretty much intuitive to say that we are going to be able to register who are believer or who are non-believer and i think this is going to be an important mechanism to change the uh to prove the change under our side of the house so um all the robots are going to be integrated to our side of the house so first question is it justifiable for democracy to force their own concept of justice note that this argument is entirely independent from the practical practical consequence whatsoever because number one we told you that there is this democracy taking over land and other land and agency of this individual in the past there are no and we think there is a moral obligation for the liberal democracy to restore and to pay reparations to these individuals and the way how they should do so is by accepting independence or i.e at least a legal liberty that they that they choose we don't think this liberal democracy has a right to hijack them just because they rob their land in the past i think it should be restored that is why it's independent of the practical consequences but second in terms of the concept of justice as long as you believe in that religion you're all you are told to believe in that ideology and you're told to subscribe to this idea or try to challenge this idea by saying that ah like these people never choose to be born in this religion but at the moment in which that you are born and believe in that religion i think i i think you already subscribe this idea so you believe in this idea right even if you are forced to do so if you believe so i think you consent to it but second thing as i still think there's a bottom-up conversation with uh okay in a moment ceo i think there is a conversation a bottom-up conversation in this religious organization for example in church must wherever i think there's a place for the bottom-up individual to talk with the priests that their interpretation can influence the top but also i think reinterpretation of the bible is something happening again and again in the history i don't think i i can't understand why or can just simply assume assume that there are absolutely no consensus over this religious idea but thirdly like as a matter of fact people believe in this idea in the first place and i think that is enough right but even if that's not the case i think uh this democratic right now i mean this right over agency is something independent of any practical consequence looking at the example of like international law right like saudi arabia has its own own form of law which united states cannot intervene and i think the reason why it happens is because even if democracy does not happen there they believe in the idea and that's enough moving before moving in the second point uh ceo just so we understand is this debate only defined for particularly religious laws or do you extend this to also apply to non-religious laws in general to be trialled in these courts and if so why is my religion so important to determining those i think it really depends to context and context right if a religious people commit a crime against non-religious individual that is no longer a solely issue about this religious court and i think it should depend on case by case i don't think this is what this emotion should specify i think it's a cri like criminal like in this religious organization and a victim in this religious organization or some particular act which is called which is a sin in this religious organization being committed by this religious individual i think that is simply out of this debate because international law doesn't like singularity define how to resolve those displays in between this community that's why i think it's a waste of time to talk about those issues so moving on to the second question about which gives more competitive comparatively acceptable consequences so i like to tell you why under opposition's world that it's going to be worse the first thing we need to understand is that understand is the opposition what you get what you never get in organic change but also you're going to get a private punishment which is massively harmful first reason why you never get organic change one because the polices are corrupted in those areas note that india in india for example there are 20 000 accidents which is seeming a murder of which is seemingly a murder as a result of violating the hinduism rule but police and these police organizations never persecute this individual forever several reasons number one because this police itself also believes in this religious rule that we have explained to you from the beginning but secondly because these police that are oftentimes bribed bribed by this own community that way they never prosecute those that is why they're more likely to have this private punishment and i think the impact of private punishment is clearly established by hostia that is to say it's going to be over punishment no accountability no visibility but secondly these people have incentive to continue this private punishment because so that is something they believe in even if they're going to get punished that is why the form of the form of the punishment that we're going to be giving you is comparatively moderate to their side of the house the reason for that is because one there's an external pressure at the moment if we have a fixed law the reason why saudi arabia recently allowed women to drive and drive a car is because of this external pressure from the united states and that is the moment in which that this private punishment for women driving the decreases are decreases and we need to have this exchange now why do we get more change so they say rebel is going to happen but that is the opposite in the status quo rich and privileged individuals in this community just try to bribe and they and enjoy their own right on the other hand on our side of the house these people are also going to be prosecuted by this court that is why this privileged and powerful religious people will be forced to fight against this change of law if you want to pray if they don't want to practice their own liberty at the end of the day that is why i think we can have more change under our side of the house for that reason because private punishment is much more harsher on the opposition bench but also it is principally justifiable and very very proud to propose this policy thank you we now welcome deputy leader of opposition yeah sorry just setting my timer the roman catholic church did not admit to galileo galilei being right about the solar system until the 90s there are still no women that are allowed in the church in high positions of power and sodomy is still abhorrent under catholic law religious institutions are behemoths that you have very little control over the rules that opening government wants to impose upon you are one so you have very many difficulties in terms of changing it is not a victory for women's rights does saudi arabia finally allow them to drive it is in fact the proof that their model doesn't work because women in other religious countries have been driving for decades it just took saudi arabia so long to catch up precisely because we allowed religious institutions to not just dictate religion but also dictate law in that country three things that we're going to talk about firstly about the principles of the law second about control and coercion and religion lastly about social segregation all responses will be integrated so firstly about principles of the law i think that overall opening government's case is based on two principles firstly the idea of sovereignty which i want to deal with from the get-go because i actually don't think that it makes that much sense they say religious institute religious communities have been sort of you know taken apart weaponized it's very sad we have taken away their sovereignty note that this is not a debate about for example indigenous communities that very frequently already live under different systems of governance the key is in the world right governance this isn't allowing religious communities to elect their own leaders and suddenly have their own sort of like mini state which we already do for example indigenous communities in many places in northern america canada and the united states this is about imposing a religious law which is completely different in fact very few religions have actually had you know their communities imposed upon the very fact is that most religions have indeed proselytized onto other countries so i don't actually think that makes sense the important difference that i want to highlight is that we allow native americans for example to have their own systems of government because they can't change the government we don't think this is true for religious institutions but i think that the more important principle that they give out is the principle of consent and i think that the problem here is that consent panel is a deeply flawed construct you can't really consent into religion and i think that tutor told you why and i don't think that we saw sufficient response from the previous speaker he gave you three reasons for it firstly it is that you're born into it that it is very difficult to control or to opt out once you are out of it precisely because that's what you were indoctrinated into the school that you went to the things that your parents don't write second that you peer pressured into it that when your whole community believes in one particular religion it is incredibly difficult to opt out of it because that means losing your friends losing the family that you grew up in losing your contacts in the world and thirdly i think that also it is the very premise of religion is coercive right it is saying that you can never prove the existence of a god but you have to believe anyway because otherwise you're gonna go to hell and burn there forever i think the principle of that is course by itself it's essentially the world's riskiest gamble if you choose to have doubt so i think that at the end of the day whatever consent you have is deeply deeply flawed and guaranteed you still have flawed consent no thank you you still have close consent when you open to a state but we think that it is fundamentally different why because a studer tells you although the criminal justice system in whatever country you're born in it's also arbitrary you have considerably more power over what you can and cannot do to change it for example you can change legislation the politicians that you vote for and you elect have considerable amount of power and even if you didn't vote for the party that is in government if a substantial majority of people voted for a policy that maybe the candidate didn't win it's still something that is debated it's still something that is considered also you can pass change to reports even if there's a minority of people that support it those are mechanisms of change that do not exist in the religion when it is all fundamentally based on scriptures and religious leaders the previous speaker tells us aha but you can still change it there is still community pressure there is right and that's true but the problem is that there's very very little of it that actually works because the very premise of the scriptures is that they were written by god that they were sent by the prophets or whoever in whatever religion you're in which means that it's very difficult to change anything that they literally said like the fact that you know sora means abhorrent as is written into like most religious texts ever or that women are not supposed to like they were born out of adam's rib or something like that the point is you're not a human you were born out of the man and i think that the important thing there is that it's very difficult to change because changing the scriptures means changing admitting that the whole religion could potentially be wrong which is why it's very difficult to change those things in a similar way religious leaders have very little incentive to change because that means admitting that the position that they're supposed to hold until they die is the wrong one because they cannot interpret the word of god properly i think the problem at the end of the day is that law holds immense amounts of power over you and that you're giving religions an immense amount of power over something that you have very little grounds to change i think that that amount of control is horrible coercive and something that we should never submit individuals under i think that the principle false even if you consent into it you can never change it would say that wrong second point on control and coercion in religion look the kinds of things are religious religion can punish you for things like sexual orientation whether or not you have an abortion whether you have sex with your marriage if you do or do not do religious celebrations even if you eat certain kinds of meat right and i think that in the status quo there's already very strong pressure within religious communities to conform but i think that this makes it 10 times worse because you can rationalize the way oh god will love me anyway but you can't what you cannot rationalize away is the actual real-life punishment that you're going to have to face for your actions i think that the problem when you dictate when you allow this kind of institutions to craft the law is that what you see as the law determines what you cannot do in your everyday life right because if you do a certain thing as a religious person then suddenly you go to court and you're punished for it that is why you saw a lot more change away from religious institutions the second that states stopped being religious precisely because when religious institutions have so much control over what you can and cannot do under the law it makes it so much harder to do social change i think that's what tutor tells you i think that we don't really get a response to uh i will take a pi from cge cg um so how exactly is it easier to get change in state courts assuming that you are also someone who has the same struggles with someone from the majority and therefore likely to face a lot of the problems existing anyway so i already mentioned two of them one is i think that you can actually win a lot of substantive cases through the courts aka if you prove something it's wrong in a court of law then you can eventually take it to the supreme court even if you're a minority right and i think that the second one is that also even if you don't vote for the majority party if there's like a small minority of people that apparently really care about climate change it's also something that bigger politicians even if they like if the candidates that you voted for didn't win you also have the capacity to then discuss those issues but i think that at the end of the day going back to like control and religion is that i think that at the end of the day the amount of control that you allow religions to then have over most individuals a controller they cannot opt out of and a control that stops them from stepping out of religion because you clamp down on them the second that they attempt to step out is crazy they say we have to stop vigilantism and the problem is that vigilantism is a long world thing right it is something that they're crazy extremists and they're gonna be crazy unless you have equally a strong loss on their side anyway right they're still gonna say ah now there's like a reason why i can go and kill their people because the state says that i should actually enforce my law but i think that at the end of the day is much worse when you impose that control on not just a few individuals but on everyone the last point on social segregation i just think that i didn't have time for this because i thought of my timing but importantly minority religions i think that at the end of the day have a very hard time integrating when they don't even respect the basic principle of common law that everyone lives under i think this is a bad idea so i think you should vote oh thank you we now welcome the member of government can you hear me yeah cool starting in three two one uh i'll have one extension about why we create a fair justice system with four sub-sections within it number one why it's something you on face value opt-in to better number two why it's easier to control religious courts uh more so than state courts number three why numbers are the only way to decide what is fair in the justice system and not by intensity number four even if intensity was the way of measuring or there was a way of measuring intensity it's better on our side first why do we believe that on face value this is something that is better than the state court this is because even if you are born into a religion arbitrarily we don't think indoctrination is a morally negative thing it is morally neutral what matters is the outcome of it and intuitively religion is always a more important part of your life than the state or your national identity is this is because your national identity is often shaped by people who are very distant to you that you often don't connect to and are often people who are taking land away from you so if states and religion are both arbitrarily random because you're born into it presumably the thing that you can connect to more closely for most number of people are something that you opt into more if the justice system is something that has to cater to what people believe is fair that's why we allow people to decide what justice is i think that on face value religion is better second why do we believe it's easier to control religious courts more so than state courts directly engaging with oh uh two reasons under this number one if your religion is from a small community we believe that there's a very small power distance you have with this religious leader meaning that the number of people within your community are less and therefore for you to get threshold into enacting change is less for you to get that in a state you have to enact literally 51 of the population that is far more difficult by virtue of numbers secondly the worst case scenario is these small communities have religious courts already the problem is these religious courts are panchayats like you see in india that are absolutely unregulated on a comparative or have to defend the worst versions of it we at least have some state regulatory checks but also you have some ability to opt in and opt out of this whereas you're educated into what kinds of courts these are the state can operate and empower moderate individuals within these small communities to take power so the status quo is one where the most oppressive versions of these courts already exist for the most vulnerable that's something that opposition has to defend let's say this is a majority religion we think that three structural reasons why they're more prone to change the mistake number one we think that the presumable reason why evolution of religion happens is for gain of political power or because they want to proselytize more people that is a wash on both worlds so when tudor says that you know we stop evolution the reasons why evolution happens is for proselytization or for political power both of that still exists in our world as well number two the internal religious interaction is something we empower i.e there's no reason for moderates to go and take down conservatives right now there's a reason why they want to always operate in the liberal bubble but the moment you say that there's only one religious court you force the moderates to come into the political discourse against the conservatives that they don't want to interact with right now so that removes the excesses of political control that the conservatives have number three religions all over time want to be all encompassing this is because every follower has the same marginal utility for them either because they believe that every follower is coming to god and that's a kpi for them that they want to cater to or because every follower can have incremental donations for them comparatively states operate on margins which means they only need 51 of people in order to keep power what they want to do is they want to have certainty of that 51 even if it means oppressive marginalization of that 49 that's why they create tough on crime policies in order to sustain the political image to the majority it is unlikely that religions when they have the opportunity to have incremental marginal utility they will be as oppressive as the state where they only have to cater to the 51 the crucial thing to note is religions and states often have laws that coalesce and are similar in nature they both punish murder equally the difference is the religions that have different laws are likely to be in the minority and states are never likely to cater to those religions this is why structurally religions are better or more able to control before going into the third area i'll take ceo yeah so why don't you want to also give other minorities a right to their own courts unless you believe that there is a general social stake here rather than just an individual um in principle we're fine with it we just think it's a different debate have another debate about it we'll accept it in principle i don't see a problem with it third why do we believe numbers are the only way to create fairness in the justice system this is because it is impossible to measure intensity there are a couple of ways in which i'd like to illustrate this number one victim closure while it is a principle in the justice system is not the only thing we consider and the reason is because intensity of that suffering could be infinite we can't cater to all victims that always recompense them for the suffering they have this is how we always create laws that the majority wants because the majority caters to numbers but we empower the minority by certain rights like freedom of expression freedom of speech so the way the justice system works is through a utilitarian metric i.e because you can't measure the intensity of individual people because it's entirely subjective the safe way to go about it is by catering to as many people as possible the problem is that principle can only be extended in our world this is because there are lots of religious individuals that just don't feel like laws that the 51 create are fair to them so the only way to cater to them is by empowering as many different kinds of courts as possible and by making sure that we cater to a greater number of people within our state the only way this principle would not make sense is if there was a direct authority the state had over people in order to decide what is good for them the problem is most of these states often not elected by religious minorities and often groups of people that take away land and oppress these religious minorities so the reason why og's principle reciprocity matters is because numbers are the only way in which you can be reciprocal to the people and what they deserve not by catering to intensity this out frames all the stuff oh says about some religious minorities suffering yeah i agree but there's a more greater number of people from the greater perspective of the religion that is suffering right now we cater to a greater number of people let's say that you don't buy this framing let's say that you care about the intensity of victims number one we think existing victims suffer a lot of intensity of harm this is because state justice is something they never approach at all this is because they either don't trust public defendants because they're from different communities that they don't trust or that have oppressed them in the past or they don't trust the system they think that judges will be racist or they don't trust the punishment itself i.e murder might not get a death sentence in one faith but gets a death sentence in religious faith which means in the most cases religious minorities are likely to not seek justice at all which is a very high intensity of suffering compared to fringe religious minorities like say lgbt individuals or women within religion number one i've already proven to you that they can push for change more so than they can do for the same that's mitigation number two they're likely to face backlash in courts anyway because they're likely to uh be de-prioritized because that black a white woman is always likely to be prioritized there's no structural mechanism for why supreme courts will cater to them number three uh there's also no reason why they won't face backlash from their communities when going to state courts so they're likely to be abandoned by their families and likely to be told that you're no longer a part of us because you're seeking justice that our religion doesn't stand for all of that is mitigation for why the change to the marginal suffering is minimal but the increase of the intensity of compensation to victims on our side is greater we are very glad to clearly win this debate thank you member for position please just a sec to avoid background noise i'm going to close them up the door that my mom opened yeah sorry am i edible yep great starting in three two one go one extension in my speech because i'm esl and i don't need more we are going to prove why essentially the principle of the justice system and the criminal justice system is particularly to serve justice to society and the state as a whole why particularly the individuals involved are not the only stakeholder and it is not their decision to make in terms of opt-in and therefore this policy is simply unjust before that few points of extendia's rebuttal firstly to the entirety of the analysis from government bench about why people do deserve some level of opt-in because they disagree with the current system please note as i said in the poi and maybe debaters are too much in a left-wing bubble to hear the word minorities and say immediately yeah but here's the thing when you have a disagreement with the current system of law is everyone out writers disagree with the current system of law left-wingers in the united states disagree with the current system of law we wouldn't let a separate code system for everyone who doesn't accept the current law right because we do believe that part of the principle of democracy is accepting what the majority of the people did choose for you especially given that there are sufficient checks and balances within the democratic system to make sure that it is not so that is not too much abused i have no idea why someone just not liking the law grants them a right to not follow it secondly we do think that there are already existing accommodations right we know that in many records today you are able to do things that make you feel more convenient such as if i am a religious woman i can ask to defile my complaint to a another religious woman within the police officers etc in order to find my complaint in order to feel safer these are things that exist if they don't exist we are happy to have them implemented you think that this is a likely alternative to already be in place which note by the way also engages cg's part about victims not approaching because we think we can make accommodations for them that actually make this approachable but secondly we do think that victims do approach regardless of this because you know they do care about their own safety i like how often in debates we characterize religious people as uh idiots was something safe if i am being continuously assaulted attacked or feeling unsafe in my community why on earth will i not complain to the current legal system just because they are not sufficiently religious they do have similar laws to my own religious system right as they agreed measure and violence is also illegal in religion why will i not cooperate to defend myself and sadly we think my own community will also let me do this so because with the absence of their own code system my religious leaders also have an incentive to maintain local peace to avoid intervention from the government in this india in their area to let everyone feel safe etc lastly on racism please know that since the debate only takes place according to og's model when both sides are in agreement to go to this system we don't think racism actually changed because it means that it necessarily only happens already when both sides are probably of the same efficiency let's get to the point so firstly why do we think that this decision heavily impacts others and you're far from being the only stakeholder in the decision and i want to clarify something here oh og from the get-go gave a definition to this debate in which both a general law and religious law is going to be applicable here right look at the prime minister's speech notes we literally wrote this down and i asked him in clarification they do concede that non-religious laws are also part of this debate but just in case you don't accept that just note how there is so much overlap between religious and non-religious laws right domestic violence is something that is inherently to be dealt with by religious leaders and obviously is also a general law sexual crimes have so much religious stakes within them literally the entirety of the legal system as we know it is based on the duty like judeo christian whatever legal like 10 commandments in the past which is why most of these things are based on that why is this crucial five reasons why this means that we impact heavily not only the ones who is filing the lawsuit or being or be or is being sued firstly keeping society safe if someone who assaulted me is now being walked away free because my legal system decided that this is the right punishment if the entirety of society is also unsafe now not just me even if i am the direct victim the fact that i and my perpetrator agree to this doesn't mean that no one else is also influenced secondly deterrence the fact that if we give different punishments in different legal systems means that we change the deterrence mechanism as a whole in society now that now i know that if i commit a crime it might be different sort of punishment also influencing society as a whole sadly rehabilitation if we send people to different periods of time in prison we also influence how they get back to society if their religious system is going to send them to too long or too short of a sentence when they come back to society they might be not sufficiently rehabilitated meaning that they are still posing a danger to the entirety of society fourthly presidents note how the criminal justice system works if we are in the same state and we implement similar laws it means that if there is a president in one legal system it is still something that can be used as an argument in another one i as a lawyer has an incentive to still use it and say look in this presidency you'd set me someone free it will be unjust to now not do the same with my clients meaning that it also trickles down to the secular justice system and fifthly just in terms of the incarceration and how it affects society as a whole note what happens if for instance we have different incarceration stats if now in the aim for if if now in the religious system we have for an instance more black people being incarcerated than white people or vice versa it doesn't even matter it means that now we impact the way biases in society work as a whole because it influences the way that we see the incarceration the incarceration stats generally afterwards note none of this is contingent even on the religious law being good or bad none of this is contingent and what are they going to the exact policies just the fact that they are different means that we are not able as a country to actually implement a united sus a united system that actually influences everyone meaning that we don't have control as a society as a whole to defend ourselves from crime we think this is the most important impact in this debate before i get to white is so atrocious oh gee i don't think religious individuals participate in democracy which is a premise for your case to happen tell me why it is fair thanks thanks a we think it's weird religious individuals do vote because they often encouraged by the religious leader to vote for things that are good for the religious individuals but secondly if they don't vote it's their choice you know what i prefer someone opting out of this system of choice out of their own volition rather than me being coerced by someone else's choice when i didn't have any opt-in or opt-out mechanism at all now why do we think it is atrocious especially because no government already concedes this how do we know this because running the model the prime minister said that if there are going to be two parties in this agreement we are going to go to the general system i just proved to you that in every incident there are two parties in this agreement because one party is always society is the state as a whole according to og's unconcession this is immoral secondly defeated by principle of choice yes maybe a choice of the many over the few is bad but it is still preferable to a choice of the few over the many right we think that it is preferable to have the entirety of society have some level of agreement on this rather than having a few deciding for everyone but lastly also on choice note how the extent of the infringement of choice is worse under their side because at least when there is a somewhat of infringement of the choice of the religious individuals we a have the system of their ability to operate and to actually vote like note again they choose not to vote but secondly we do have some extensive mechanism on the ecosystem as they have something love everyone everyone holds it accountable but when it is internal and not everyone notices those small tweaks not everyone is going to follow them a comfortable way tomorrow this might hold me because the settlers notice as much what happens in the non-secular quotes for all those reasons never been proud of your vote thank you we now welcome the office the government with okay i'll deal with closing opposition first and then move on to my issues so i think closing opposition basically says look on principle we disagree because it's against the principle of democracy or whatever so they say that everyone this means that if a community disagrees that everyone can just opt out i don't see a principal problem with that if there is a significant community of people that have their own sense of laws that they all agree to there is absolutely no moral objection from our side and it's a principle that we have stood for so what do they say they say ah but we can't ensure justice to all um so this is their principle right so as long as we can't ensure justice to all because it affects everyone that means we shouldn't take it the problem with this is of course is that that principle then is still contingent on them providing better justice for all in the first place which we don't think they do so why did they say to do to try and prove this they say first ah deterrence will be differently affected first of all um note that for the policy to work both the criminal and the defendant have to opt into the system in the vast majority of cases you really won't be able to check whether or not the other person you are trying to you know attack has actually gone into the office to try and opt into the system or not so we don't necessarily think that works but also just like common sensically speaking deadlines don't really change much based on how much the punishment changes unless it's like really drastic or like there's some punishment versus no punishment at all so we don't really think it makes as big of a difference as they would like to say then the next thing they say okay they try to touch on a big issue of rehabilitation they say rehabilitation will be differently affected the problem with this argument is of course that they absolutely forget status score where there is absolutely no focus on rehabilitation of the marginalized and the minority communities in the first place but they are thrown into prison for decades and allowed to just be incarcerated for long periods of time so for them to say rehabilitation is affected maybe that's a good thing that some people can opt into better rehabilitation systems potentially and because it really like it it's really hard to imagine a worse rehabilitation system where more than 80 percent of the people who go to prison come back out and go back into prison within a year right um so loss of control of the state to a certain extent would happen but obviously we have shown how it is limited but we don't necessarily see why it's bad when the system is just bad but note also that their argument is also then contingent on being able to prove that the state is indeed a good actor to be able to do those things from closing opposition an analysis for which they're dependent on opening opposition so we think in the opposition event provides the analysis that they rely on which we will take down from cg so first let's explain what do these thoughts look like in the first place and i think this is a huge amount of conversation coming from the opposition bench because we like to pretend that like we have this civilized society with like common sense laws and then these religious communities just don't make any sense at all while sometimes yes of course they have some problematic things but at the same time we must also acknowledge the converse so for example religious scot systems are often are significantly more class conscious and how they affect their pain and how they implement the justice systems just because they're rooted historically in class struggles and how they were formed right you know in a way that the capitalist system right now is simply not which means it  over the poor in a way that many religious systems simply don't such as islam right secondly when we talk about like the fact of rehabilitation right mental health focus exists significantly more within indigenous communities because of the spiritual lifestyle that they often lead so if you look at korea communities in new zealand for example in their court system they're significantly more likely to consider rehabilitation and the mental focus on the rehabilitation of that person as opposed to the actual justice system of the country in the first place because we are not aware of those things and opening opposition can't get away with saying this debate is not about indigenous people because i don't think you can just say ah indigenous people don't count as religion because they too have religious beliefs you can't just define it differently just because they're indigenous people so we think the fact that these people are screwed over continuously by the state also has to be taken into account so the harms really exist in different forms but also exists in both systems so what is then that they say they say but ah you have to consider consent of course they also ultimately consider that the consent problems like exist symmetrically but because all the indoctrination issues everything also exists on the under their side now note actually it's not symmetrical it's more on their side because you're literally forced by the country you're born into to be able to go go into a particular system of law at least under our world even if coercion is higher you have some ability to opt out as opposed to none under their side but would also suggest that the likelihood of you being able to opt out has been significantly uh like exaggerated by their side because when we talk about minority religious communities in the west while there are some really ultra people what would suggest is the ability for you to opt out is not as hard as they think a lot of muslim immigrant third generation second generation children for example are coming out of their religions when they live in america because they have a society friend structure support structures they can sometimes be able to obtain we acknowledge this is hard but it is not completely forced like you are just born into the system in the first place but also note that the fact that this is an opt-in mechanism means you have to actively go into and say i opt into this particular system in the first place which also means the likelihood of them opting is not there right um before i move on opening consent is not just something that you opt into once it is a continuous thing which is why it's important that you have the capacity to change the law i think that it's very hard to do that with scriptures that have existed for generations upon which the literal legitimacy of a religion relies on right fair so i think at this point opening opposition says but why should you care about their constant argument because they say that the ability to change so note that their constant argument is contingent on them proving that the accountability that they hold over governments is more than the accountability you can hold within your own religious system let's deal with why we're significantly more accountable right first of all i think they said leaders are but leaders significantly in religious committees depend a lot more on community respect than political leaders do but note that they cannot gaslight their populations by by they cannot gaslight the population because the community is small in a way that capitalist systems and political systems can do through the media for example right but scripture can a obviously been interpreted by the opening set but also i would like to add that the constitution is often held in just a similar amount of reference by the political community which means changing political systems and laws is actually often just as hard if not harder in opposition because at least we have some incentives to change and progress like it pointed out which is because religions want to update and take in as many people as they want as opposed to where religious and whereas the state has perverse incentives to for example cater to white communities in order to be tough on crime and so on and so forth really if you're really going to rely on the argument that you can challenge it through the supreme court while being a poor minority person or that oh you can go out and protest and things will change you're not living in the real world where this causes humongous amounts of harm to them right but finally i think they never really dealt with such as uh principle in terms of like how we cannot evaluate intensity and therefore we must extend to as many people as they as we can the religious systems they believe in regardless of whether they're indoctrinated or not but they also do not deal with the argument that people often feel left out and don't report a hijabi person is not going to go to the police if they feel the police never listen to a hijabi woman in the first place but if they have their own system they're more likely to report and be able to deal with that and the alternative is significantly worse systems without any public scrutiny that they often go to we propose thank you um we now welcome opposition am i audible yeah three two one panel hedonics an incredibly straightforward case what she argues is that in all instances in every instance where crime occurs society is harmed regardless given that this mechanism even if both sides freely and openly con consent to this and this were a given fundamentally speaking then we don't underst then we don't understand how governments can just say oh but as long as people consent then everything is covered we argue onside opposition very simply that no at the point where society already generally speaking agrees on what the laws are what the punishments for those things are then that is where that consent and that agreement stems in note however before i get into the specific weighing of that in this debate i do want to extensively uh engage with what we just heard from a government whip firstly let's just deal with this idea that these courts would create justice where no other would okay let's say you are someone who harmed someone else who knows that in the regular state system you will not get punished but in the religious system you will why ever in any world would you agree to a system that you know will punish you when you know according to cg's logic the other system will not punish you that is insane no it's not that's not how that works if you know you face no obs no punishment that you won't consent to it that's the fatal problem that cg has they don't actually deal with the fact that they have to stay in line with opening government's you know model when opening government tells us both sides need to agree with it secondly they argue their side can assure justice to all which doesn't at all which note their and what do they mean by this they can't they say they ensure better justice for all they don't really quantify for us what better or worse justice is we're not entirely sure on that but we say very simply we actually think best justice is when justice is equal and predictable for everyone equally regardless of their community and society we say justice is best when it is equal note that that um mubarak responds to us that says oh but they the closing opposition doesn't prove to us that they have better justice no that saddar's entire speech is that we have better justice simply on the metric that we have equal justice and there is not a line of response or comparative to that specific case yeah i can strawman a case too and then engage with that but that's not actually what hadal said note additionally however what we then get is this idea of ah but in status quo there isn't the focus on rehabilitation isn't given because you know america puts a lot of people in jail and maybe not focusing on it so much is you know good first of all let's keep this debate in functioning democracies you know in germany and in europe and in other functioning democracies like australia and other places we don't generally put three percent of our population and 10 of a minority population in jail but even if that's the case we think as long as society agrees you know that's probably the case especially given that most of those people who are being put in jail by the state have not committed a crime against another member of their community the crimes they're generally put in in in jalen are either crimes where you know they robbed a store and then why would the store agreed to that consent or they killed someone or they did something to another person of another identity group in which case that entire case is out of this debate i'm sorry cg but you do kind of need to stay in line with what your opening government models for us in this debate but let's go even a step further let's say for some reason they didn't have to stay in line and couldn't knife their opening government in terms of the of that material let's say that they're right and that maybe this creates a bit more justice and a bit of a fair uh a system of access for these individuals note that this still doesn't engage with hadow's problem which establishes that in general a governance a system of legislation and judiciary is still equally appliable to all meaning that the precedent that one court creates is something that can then be applied to another court we think this is something intrinsically damaging especially if given that you know we generally think that as all religious groups will have their own courts some of those will happen to be more conservative some of those will have to be worse some of those will be actually more harmful and punish things that we as society generally don't think should be punished more heavily and that will serve as a precedent for other courts to then be used to punish those those groups not a single line of response from cg on that one either i think at this point it's fairly obvious why they don't really stand in this debate however just just in case there is one final thing we hear from them and this is the following they tell us that ah but if um right they tell us that uh there's no uh there's no impact on the courts aside from this um that there's no impact on the courts in general note that additionally if that's true then why then why do we need this if these courts genuinely operate in the exact same fashion any other court would then the only thing they actually care about is this access point note that gives three alternatives to this specifically in terms of we can have you know the a's who are the same identity of that group we have we can have police officers who are that same identity of that group we can have all these people be part of the general system and we should imply implement that however we think you know just in in terms of that even if that's true there's no uh alternative there sure cg cg um so if these principles are more important than people's input why don't you just have a technocratic system that decides laws based on what is most deterring and what is most retributive in nature that's generally what we have it's called the election process where all of us agree on what those laws should be and then those are implemented lastly we think that's already dead oh let's deal with the weighing them because quite frankly i think opening opposition obviously does quite a reasonable job we obviously stand in line with them but we think there is one particular problem with opening opposition which is in the end of the day their impacts rely on the fact that people who would really be screwed over by these laws would still opt into these courts we're not entirely sure if this is you know a very fair way towards the opening government team we don't think it's necessarily a universally true argument we think that generally speaking people who would genuinely be harmed by this to the extent that they claim would probably not opt into and not opt into these courts and at that point i'm not sure to what extent even though their impacts are obviously quite large that is true however even if we think that someone who is generally an apostate and lives and quote unquote immoral according to that religion lifestyle would still opt into those courts we don't necessarily think that's something that's like intrinsically evil for them we think however that our impact that is on a societal general level and always applies regardless of the circumstance regardless of whether people opted into freely or not because that harm happens against society in general and fundamentally and always we think that our case in terms of the impact it just stands more broadly and irrespective of whether or not people opted into it or not and this is specifically why we think we win this debate from closing opposition proud to oppose all right thank you um we so the judges are now gonna chat i think the procedures i should let orcom know um and then we'll get back to you when we have a decision thank you very much and just to remind everyone you guys are supposed to just leave the breakout room and join the main room and not leave the zoom call entirely yeah the speakers right yeah this year yes yes
