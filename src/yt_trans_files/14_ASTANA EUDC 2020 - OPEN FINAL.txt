Video Title: ASTANA EUDC 2020 - OPEN FINAL

Transcript:
 all right everyone welcome to the open final of astana eudc online uh congratulations to all of the teams for having made it thus far into the tournament um so my name's lucia and i'll be your chair preferred priority she but please refer to the panel as a whole and joining me in the panel are lover lucy melda milos rafi and daso sebastian um so without further ado thing as we all know the teams that are in the open final would like to welcome the prime minister to begin his speech that stands in their name here here can everybody hear me [Applause] cool three two one firstly our model is that we allow this all the time you can do this on the spot you can do that before the action takes place for example before protest takes place you are allowed we are not going to judge you whenever you're doing it however we don't think this is going to happen very often firstly because policemen always believe that they have a duty towards their country and a duty like a general duty to follow orders although other conscience cannot wait out secondly there's training so you know you're going to be trained like you're straining that you should follow others and you know the importance of following orders so in general you know this three there is trust within a police community in a police sort of uh uh a group and you know you cannot screw your policeman over and that will enter into your calculus and when you think about your conscience so you don't necessarily do this all the time you don't necessarily going to bring all the policemen in danger but you are going to do this when uh you definitely think that this is problematic three points one autonomy of individual policemen secondly white policemen overall will handle things better and thirdly there's a fly on the camera why uh this like orders my following orders is like refusing these specific orders which are going to be refused is usually better than following them firstly autonomy of individual policemen firstly you're literally forcing orders to use force against people this is not a democratic choice which the government the parliamentary of this is just an order from someone who is like a little bit higher on your ranking this is a split decision it's not democratically elected and we have no idea where you can force on someone to do something that's against their conscience we think that is horrible these per people are literally like that that's just evil even if they say that you chose to be on a police force so you can do you one didn't know everything in advance the political landscape might change when you become become a police officer you might have loyalty and you don't necessarily want to go we don't necessarily think that you should be forced to do like to harm citizens to harm people that in your in your community when you don't want to do that we think this is incredibly important if the rest is a wash you should decide on this secondly why are police officers in general going to be nicer firstly now it is very easy to have groupthink so every time you you don't feel the individual responsibility because you can always say i was just following orders that means that you're going to be morally divorced from what you do from uh the outcomes of that so you're going to think this is not necessarily something that was a result of your action but it is a result of the orders that we're giving to you which you have to follow in every circumstance and otherwise you're going to be punished so you're not going to think for yourself there's also no reason to think for yourself at the at the uh at the outset so the problem is in groupthink in police office uh sort of uh uh uh constituencies you can get incredibly racist groups and nobody thinking individually for themselves what they're doing we are policy means that you are constantly forced to think about it you see other policemen doing this you see other policemen sort of making that decision you know that this is something that you can do and that you should do and it's also a part of your duty as a police officer to do this for yourself that means that you're not going to go with this group thing that means that we can stop the worst kinds of cases of police brutality where people only think what the group is thinking only following orders we are not having that on our side of the house if you don't think that sort of the orders are better or worse than the individual trade of the policemen can make you can decide to wait on this we think that you should propose why are the other orders refused more likely to be bad than good three reasons firstly there's greater distance between the person making that decision giving that order the policeman on the street so your policemen on the street can know what a protest looks like you can know what a person who was sort of arrested for having drugs looks like and what their situation is you know that that's the poor person if you arrest them you know they're going to be in jail then they're going to go out of june gong beating jill again as a police officer you can say look i'm not willing to participate in that and we think that's usually a good choice because you have more information and you also have experience as a police officer that is great secondly usually the people who get promoted and give these orders are older conservative people who were promoted by even more conservative people that means that they usually have a tendency to not care as much about minorities and younger people who have who are usually in the police force so you get that much more on our side of the house you think that's more beneficial they're more in line with the general society and what they think and their conscience also more in line with the general society thirdly you don't get politicized ideas and politicized orders on our like or corrupt orders what you get on opposition side is the orders being given by someone who is one more likely to be corrupt because they are influenced by for example property development or where they have to arrest a lot of people and you don't get that on our side of the house where policemen individual like individual policemen are less likely to be corrupt that is a nice but secondly you get extremely politicized orders what does that look like because the person who is giving the orders it has to like answer to the person above that means that you get extremely politicized orders why is this bad because politics is usually really bad at deciding criminal policy or how to respond to a protest usually not decided very well by the government because i only have the incentive to drag down it's hard to make it stop so that i don't look bad that is extremely bad but that's not a trade-off that is necessarily good right because you always have to like because there are easy solutions which are popular which the the general people support such as arresting literally everybody who has like one gram of weed with them which don't make lives better which make life significantly worse on our side of the house you get policemen who refuse that we think they are sometimes likely to do that because sometimes people are willing to make that decision they see the harms of their own individual actions and now they're constantly asked to do this i want a py from seattle given that we send police officers into a life or this death situation do you think it's acceptable to send them in with unreliable partners okay even if the policeman's harmed one day church arrests suit after duty thirdly they can protect themselves where other people can't if you are attacking as a police officer protesters they don't necessarily have that we think the trade-off falls in our centers even if they say you can send in other policemen who are might be worse i think one they're not worse because you're morally diverse and therefore they're not necessarily worse than emotions take over in the split second secondly you cannot always have other policemen because for example in a protest finding that means that you need a lot of people and you cannot always give the same orders they will get different orders because you see that this happens it's extremely humiliating you know you're not going to get a promotion if your officers are cursed constantly refusing your orders that means you'll give different orders which are more in line with the general population which are not based on corruption which is not based on stupid policy that the politics on that moment like to give different orders and we also like that these are not individual policemen or beating the out of people who did nothing therefore propose we thank the speaker for that speech and i would like to welcome the leader of opposition to begin the case for the up in the debate here sure okay we think that at the point where you are allowing ed policemen to refuse others on the reason of conscience it is much more likely that the responsibility in terms of the system is going to be put on the individual police officer rather than on the system we think it is much more likely that the system is the one that is broken it is much more important that we have the tools to hold it accountable to fix it because it's unlikely to be the southern police officer we're going to talk uh about how this shifting responsibility happens and we're going to talk about the negative outcomes that this has first of all a few points of rebuttal it's easier to do for someone to do something against unconscious notice that anyone who works for the state is beholden to the democratic powers of the state if i'm going to be a judge i might have to judge according to laws that i don't personally agree with if i'm going to be a public defender i'm going to have to prosecute for cases which i do not personally believe are going according to my values because these are the laws that's been decided by the majority if i'm working inside any government ministry i have to do what the minister is telling me what the parliament is telling me even if i think that the ideology that is being pushed through with these uh um systems that i'm told to develop is not an ideology this idea that someone can't consent to be in a job where they are doing a public service and thus are giving up some of the right in order to uh uh um fulfill this public service it's just focused and we think that we wouldn't accept it any other thing and we don't accept it here right then they tell us you can think for yourself right so we want to talk about two different situations first of all we think that if this is the order you've been given in advance this doesn't handle people's ability to think in for themselves at all if you think in advance that something is being done wrong you always can come and complain to someone who's more senior come and complain to the department is doing investigations in the police and make sure that this thing is not happening we think that the relevant cases in this debate are therefore the cases where you are actually in a police action at the moment and decide that you don't want to partake in something that your commander tells you to do we think that uh probably in this case it is not good for you to think for yourself right a we think that for every account they tell you look maybe this obviously is not going okay am i audible now uh you are now uh but the light um so i posted around two minutes on my watch what yeah yeah that's fine that's correct okay good so for the police officers who thinks oh we shouldn't uh you know prosecute people for holding marijuana that was probably another police officer thinks violence against women isn't a real problem or they shouldn't protect minorities we really don't know which case is more more relevant we do know that in general the police is going to walk according to the laws dictated by the state and therefore these are probably the people who should be able to make the decision as in any other government office but we also think that it's very important for the police officers to know that they can reliably walk together right you need when you're on the ground they're doing police action if one police officer suddenly decides they don't want to partake in the action that makes it much more likely that the people you're trying to chase get away that someone with a gun can actually threaten the other people because you didn't see they have a gun and you're like no i don't want to shoot them but the other police officer was your commander actually notice that they have a gun and that is why they're telling you to shoot at the point where you don't choose them you're putting all the other police officers in danger right we think that the reason you have a commander in the police force is because you know that he can take over the information and all things in and because you need a single head making the decisions because you need to make sure that the people are unified lastly we just want to know about police brutality that often uh uh uh the people who are doing police but to doing it against the rules and we think that this is not something we've been ordered to do we think that also police brutality is really probably a big problem in countries that are actively not doing things to stop it like the united states we think that many other countries have more diversity and the police force have more better training and have better things like nothing just police mortality is not a wide problem we think that probably this means that the united states has other ways to solve its stupid police force let's talk about moving the shifting of responsibility we think that look the moment that you're allowed to do this so first of all on the police level there's obviously an incentive to make sure that the more uh less senior people are the ones that get all the blame right because the first of all the senior people are the ones that are making the decision within the police force second of all uh it's much more embarrassing for the police the most senior the person who is making the mistake and because we think that probably they are just uh they got to be seniors because the people in the police also think that they are meaningful and important and we think that uh uh they don't want to take away their responsibilities so that means they are likely to shift the blame as much as they can on the personal police but we also think the media is likely to focus on the personal policy so because it's much easier first of all to demonize the person who actually pulled the trigger to say here is the correct cause this song is very easy to identify and to say he is the one who should have done otherwise he's the one who holds the blame right we also think that the police officers know that everybody else knows that they have this option to uh refuse and that means that if they did not refuse they know that they are going to be blamed everybody their friends their families their colleagues will be like uh you are going to be with us before we continue to talk about the terrible house that according to the police force i will take sieges why are officers not judged today for police brutality we think in most developed countries they are we think the united states is an extreme case which for some reason for many political reasons has decided it does not want to serve police brutality and if you had a political will it could do this like any other developed nation you take away qualified immunity you have more diversity in the police force you have better training and all of these things we think that that's just not a real problem let's talk about uh uh uh because we think that first of all that means that you have much less incentive to complain when bad things happen and when there is cases of police brutality all that things why is that because we think that og is correct in telling you the analysis and notice that this is analysis they already give you therefore all the things in the debate conceive this that the police officer is very unlikely to refuse in the vast majority of cases because there is a lot of pressure to uh do the thing that my officer tells me because this is what my colleagues expect of me because i trust that the police commander is smarter than i am because uh usually the bad things that happen are going to be part of some larger cultural uh benefit and we think that that means that uh at the point where i know that i'm very likely to be blamed for the things that have happened and probably i didn't refuse on the ground but i need to complain to them after the fact i must much less likely to do it because i'm much more likely to be blamed for having done nothing for not trying to change it for why did you not refuse there's going to be much more personal cost to me in terms of my colleagues and my family and my future employment and as a result this means we're not getting all the problems out there in the air we think if o og wants to solve the problem of senior officials who are corrupt and of their things like and racist and things like that you must actually know the information in order to solve this and we are not getting the information on those sides right but we also think that the fact that it's so easy to throw the blame on the individual police officer who needed to refuse and did not refuse which is much easier than putting blame on seniors which as we said you don't want to put blame on them that means there is much less uh attention to the systemic problems within the system right we think that probably if a senior police officer is giving a bad comment he's giving many other bit comments and we think many other officers in the same station are also giving bad comments this is not something someone does just on the spell of the month if it's one small mistake and that's the only one mistake we do in the life this is less important right and we think that the systemic reasons are exactly type of things like having qualified immunity having no diversity in your police station the types of ammunition that you are allowed to use the rules of engagement engagement and the type of training that people get at the point where people blame the specific police officer you don't actually investigate and therefore you don't uncover the systemic reasons for these reasons we think we get better police force on our side please thank the speaker for the remarks and to continue the case for our side government we welcome the deputy prime minister here here my audible yeah thank you sorry three two one first on engagement with opening government i think two points that i think are relatively reasonable to remove the idea that you are equally unwilling to de-enforce and to act on an order about violence against women as to arrest a child or a teenager for dealing weed is implausible one because ultimately violence against women is something that triggers oftentimes in us like a visceral response that this is wrong there is nothing inherent biological in humans that thinks a drug is something that is wrong to use i think we are however responding credibly poorly and we want to change something at the point where someone is being physically harmed where they are being beaten up where there is a victim and someone who is victimizing them i think this is an incredibly strong impulse that is significantly stronger than the impulse to a restaurant to arrest someone for drugs but secondly i think you are just also just selfishly likelier to er on the side of caution because i think it is significantly less likely that you are going to be held individually liable for having not arrested a kid for weed at the point where however you have to tell say your wife that you didn't arrest someone and because you chose unconscious that someone beating their wife is not a bad thing i think you are probably likely to experience selfishly important social consequences secondly i think on the idea that this destroys trust and efficacy within police forces which i think comes out of ceo's poi and also somewhat of opening opposition what are responses to that one i think it is specifically with regard to like in individual actions where you are structurally dependent on each other i think louis already points out there's a strong counter incentive to leaving people that you think need you specifically to be safe i think that is presumably not the situation in protest where there's basically like a police army out there where one single person leaving is not decisive and it is specifically them acting on their conscience but at the point where there is a life or death situation that you know is life or death and you think that carrying it out is morally in any sense defensible you're probably going to do it if however you don't think it is morally defensible i think that is a way of that you make given the fact that you know your colleague is going to die at which point i think the way of that would need to exist for that is that someone else is going to die and we have no reason to prefer the life of a police officer being saved over the life of a non-police officer who never consented necessarily into violence being saved i think specifically louis already gives you a wing for why we would prioritize civilians and so far as they are generally speaking less able to defend themselves but two more responses to the notion of trust within police forces given the fact that you consider this within your decision making i think you're likely to have conversations with your fellow police officers about it you're like you discuss what is on your conscience and you are likely to specifically address what you are willing to deal with i think it also gives you leverage vis-a-vis your commander second mechanism to inform them at the point where multiple of you socially agree that something that has previously been ordered is unconscionable to bring that up and have that changed by the way orders changing was in louis no response that's mildly sad talking about the last thing they have in terms of actually effectively fixing police because we need to focus on the system one i think you are significantly likely to focus on the system when you have individuals saying this was asked of me and i didn't do it i think this is something that means they are of a massively stronger moral position in front of society than someone saying this was asked of me and i did it because the moment that you did it you are a hypocrite you are someone who's only now speaking up for media attention you are someone who was willing to violate someone but is now willing to actually but is now trying to push off the blame on their superior i think that's a weak moral position there's a stronger moral position at the point where you refuse be thought because you thought it was wrong but secondly i think it is incorrect ultimately that this is not the fault of the individual police officer because ultimately you are still the one who pulled the trigger and i think specifically putting that responsibility on every single person who is ever in that situation and making them aware of the fact that they are personally culpable for doing immoral things is structurally important for making them consider not doing them even when there is an order to do it because an order is just not good enough as an excuse and people shouldn't believe that it is lastly i think ultimately um in terms of the idea that you don't complain after the fact because you think that you will be held personally responsible i think you already are morally held responsible for having acted in an unconscionable way to the degree that you are anyway i think the change that you should have done better and that you should have done differently is much likelier to motivate you individ in the individual situation where you think that someone is more something is so morally disgusting that you're willing to disappoint your superiors and your friends because you are so morally compelled by that because you have empathy telling you not to do something i think that is more likely where that influences your decision point then two years after where you're thinking of maybe should i talk about the fact that this was wrong or not um yeah that was a response let's talk about individual accountability i think individual accountability gets significantly better results for police officers but secondly i think it is also the correct reflection of the autonomy they have in terms of carrying out their decisions one they reflect on what they would be willing to do or not i think this is something that is incredibly important because right now as a police officer oftentimes you don't because you know that you will have an order and you will have to carry it out unless you want to lose your job to go to prison oftentimes penalties for failing to follow orders and status quo are quite extreme that means you are better off not thinking about it because at the point where you have thought about it and made a mental commitment not to do something that means you would be in a much worse position when that thing is asked of you secondly now you have a fear of judgment you have a fear of people looking at you as the person who did this you have a fear of being individually morally called out for it i think that's incredibly useful in terms of making people think about it in advance thinking about thinking about it in the moment because this is something that is incredibly useful for motivating behavior lastly i think it is integrated into your moral framework and i think your moral framework specifically in the moment is usually quite good because humans are empathetic we understand if someone is suffering and it makes us sad that increases with proximity to the suffering it decreases with being someone in a room somewhere who's likely been bought out by a local politician and has no reason to care secondly i think that ultimately you are likely to be not wanting to think of yourself as racist not wanting to think of yourself as an unfair being and when you have to directly carry out an action as opposed to giving a generalized order that is likely to dictate what you are going to do i think people are able to do different and we should be aware of the fact that it is wrong to collaborate with orders that are evil it should be people's individual job to evaluate this at every single point that they do so orders and discretion are not well democratically legitimized when it comes to criminal justice one because there's often a very limited option set on the table due to the political incentives that no one wants to be soft on crime two because the correct solutions to it are oftentimes so counterintuitive that they never enter the ballast that means that oftentimes the degree to which people had a democratic choice in terms of what they endorse is incredibly incredibly limited secondly individuals who give orders are almost never democratically legitimized that means you're effectively just telling someone to do something because someone thought you would be good at that job that is not a good enough mechanism ultimately we get better orders on our side less violent orders less morally reprehensible orders we get less groupthink we have police departments that are actively thinking about what is right and what is wrong what they are willing and not to enforce i think ultimately the mechanism for that is better in opening government vote og thank the speaker for that speech and now to conclude for opening opposition we welcome the deputy leader of opposition here okay okay okay uh can you hear me yeah starting in three two one panel widespread police brutality does not spring out of nowhere it does not come from every single individual policeman randomly deciding that they have lost all of their empathy that all the mechanisms that og tell you about suddenly don't exist in their brain and they've all become psychopaths police brutality at the level that we've seen at the level that needs to be changed comes from systemic widespread lack of proper training lack of proper diversity lack of proper accountability mechanisms we want to put the focus there because that is the only way in which we actually solve these problems so proud to oppose i'm going to talk to you about this in terms of talking about how we engage with those widespread problems and why we're stopping the largest cases of police brutality on outside and then we're going to talk about the efficacy of the police and why it's illegitimate and practical to them let's start by dealing how do we actually stop this because neta gets up and she tells you the problem that we have here is with the systemic issues right as we said this does not magically spring out of nowhere you don't magically get tons of police officers and police brutality the level at which we've seen it and if we think that there are a few individual cases of individual police officers who have lost their empathy who are brought down in setting if this system is correct and the accountability mechanisms are in place then they will be held accountable with inside their own police force anyway right the problem therefore has to be systemic what are the systemic problems that have led to the horrors that we've seen in the united states and in other places across the world we're talking about the lack of proper training and the lack of understanding and like keeping people from being trigger happy and ways in which they engage with that we're talking about the lack of diversity on the police force we're talking about the kind of ammunition and guns that they're told to go out with and into which situation such that they inherently when they have to shoot are going to kill innocent people we're talking about the way in which you have active accountability mechanisms that are allowed to work and people don't get punished for telling on their friends and move down and demoted in their jobs we're talking about all of those things and we're telling you that we don't solve them on our government's side of the house why is this and why did we just not get sufficient responses to this by any means one neta tells you that when you do this and when you put the accountability on the person as openly government are the ones who are telling you this is what you're doing now this is the change that is happening in terms of the perception both for the person themselves and for the media that is where they focus that is who they interview that is who they say you are the person you are the last part you shouldn't have pulled the trigger you shouldn't have made that decision we think that that becomes the story instead of focusing on the widespread problems instead of focusing on the fact the super super non-interesting non-sexy story of the fact that the training just wasn't good enough of the fact that there wasn't enough diversity on the police that is much less interesting than talking about the person who murdered someone else you get you don't get that accountability second of all we tell you that the people at the top push this problem onto these individuals they say look we gave the order we thought it was reasonable in fact it makes sense look this person on the ground still did the thing they're the ones who took the action they had the most information as opening government are telling you themselves so it's not our fault obviously if he also agreed with us it must mean that it made sense in the moment that it was a reasonable thing to do you ignore the problems that systematically happen at the top thirdly we tell you these people are much less likely to come forward because what happens is and opening government analyzes you themselves people are very very very unlikely to refuse orders in the moment in fact we think they're often very unlikely to refuse orders at all because of the training that they're getting and because of the fact that they have accountability for their friends and because of the fact that they're going to face condemnation all of these things what this means is that in the moment and in the split second in which you're making this decision you cannot let down your friend in this moment you don't know what you're doing you haven't decided but after the fact the next day the next week you might actually recognize this was a terrible order that i was given but when the responsibility seems to have been on me as opening government once so badly that is the point at which i am much less likely to report on it and so even if once i report i'm seen as a hypocrite and people are less likely to listen to me okay i don't care that i'm seen as a personal hypocrite the question is therefore whether or not any like that story comes to life at all whether or not anyone knows that these orders have been given that these things have happened we think this happens on a much much larger scale on our site we get almost no responses to this analysis in terms of this systemic change what do we get we got one we just get told the hypocrisy thing we don't think that actually responds to any of this but secondly we tell you this is just the most important thing in this debate why is this the most important thing in this debate what we tell you is that individual people individually stopping themselves from committing these acts is incredibly incredibly unlikely for all of the mechanisms that opening government already told you which means that if the problem here is in terms of creating those systemic changes that is the only way in which we're actually likely to get any change some very few people might tomorrow take the action to stop that they haven't today but we think that it is a tiny number of people and we think the systemic changes are much much greater second of all we tell you that even if there were some people who who it is in their conscience and they would stop most of those people would do that right now because if you literally think that you're about to shoot an innocent person or super beat them up or anything like that then when you're allowed to you're likely to stop that today anyway because you have that level of empathy if you have that level of conscience the number of people that opening government actually affecting in their behavior is minuscule the extent to which we're changing the nature the extent to which would bring the focus on the people who need to have the focus put on them is massive on our side if we want to stop police brutality we need to focus on the real problem we do not need to blame the people on the ground who do not have access to making those systemic changes before i continue i will take opening yes the fact that you refuse an order usually does not lead to more police brutality therefore it will not add to the already existing narrative of bad apples i genuinely didn't understand that poi do you want to say it again sorry so the fact that you're going to refuse orders doesn't lead to more police brutality so it's not going to add to the already existing narrative of already of bada right yes we know that refusing an order doesn't increase police brutality we think it's incredibly unlikely but we think that what it does is lead to all of the mechanisms that we talked about in terms of not fixing the systemic problems at the top that is the thing that we're talking about okay cool then let's move on to talk about this question of police and trust because here what we get up in terms of legitimacy is just the claim that individual people on the ground should be able to make this decision for themselves we say that this is not the most important thing in this debate we say that people individual people on the ground often one don't have access to the actual necessary information to make this decision in that moment that is to say they're not aware of the full details of the operation they're not aware of exactly of the fact that there's another operation going on that forces them to say have to uh to have to bring in this individual that they they're not aware of they're not aware of the fact that someone else has seen that this other person is holding a weapon and therefore they have to shoot they have to be able to respond in those split-second decisions and to not have to be making them uh for themselves we also think that the people around them have to know that they are making this in order to be careful and want to know in order to know that this person has their back that if they're told that they're given an order everyone is going to respond accordingly why is it so important one we think principally people have these police officers who are giving the the position into in terms of endangering their lives have the right to this protection and the right to the understanding that they are going to be protected by the people around them but second of all we think that the likely situation is that otherwise you get much worse if what you're worried about is anyone ever refusing an order in because this is now a thing they do your vetting of who you're letting onto your police force and who you're letting around you becomes means you're much less likely to allow people with the quantities on for all those reasons please oppose thank the speaker for that speech and indeed both teams on the top half to begin for the closing debate we welcome the member of government here here okay three two one in this amazing open final full of esl speakers and miriam the better common we are extremely happy to stand in closing government our case it is that is in direct engagement with ooh firstly that the police officer will refuse the the order and in the right cases and this allowance is the specific data that will allow that and this causes us to enable the systematic change and strong public uh criticism against the comparative of internal investigation and lack of transparency that are the root causes for the systemic uh failures that oh is talking about therefore all of my rebel would be integrated let's talk about our first case why we will have these going against the grain firstly we think the burden here is that they actually have the opportunity to do so uh they have the opportunity to go up to refuse the order in the appropriate time this happens because police officers officers when they're patrolmen which is lucky case answers a call it's not deployed in advance this is your mission go and do that like a soldier they hear there's something here and there and there go do that og talked to us about protest we we think that most of the cases are the george floyd's of the world the eric garners like you see somebody acting in some way and you respond to that specifically you respond as a policeman by reading the situation by the information that you have on the spot now why this allowance makes the change in the relevant moment let's talk about the psychology of the police officer police officers make decision by gut feeling and training both of them are required to make decisions now we think we have a training that tells you this is a bad response and if anybody a superior officer tells you to do that you need to refuse this is a this is uh what are your rights as a police officer to refuse secondly what is an illegitimate order and what is in specifically what is an illegitimate order that you need to refuse right now why this kind of training likely to happen because once you have this policy at large and police departments want to appear to the public as hearing public pressure as being reliable which is massively in the interest of police departments to have cooperation with local communities with the community at large they need to have this training as part as an inherent part of this motion if you allow them to do that you need to explain to them when they are allowed to do that know that in the comparative as all say all of the training is for obeying the hierarchy and even therefore if you even if you have the gut feeling of this is wrong that person isn't a danger to me you firstly don't know what to do with it because you didn't have the training and you're primed very hardly against that because you're trying to obey your superiors also you always consider the option that you will be fired and now you have procedural defense against that now let's engage with all while they refuse in the right cases because all are what are these kind of cases firstly these are cases where the person you're you're arresting is unarmed and helpless maybe erratic and and and hard to predict but not dangerous and also if they're running away and therefore they are not dangerous but my superior officer or the one next to me still says shoot true truth they're dangerous but note that these are people that we rely on in general to have the right response to these uh uh situations but now as i always say all of the rest of the training is for cooperation with your fellow officers obey the hierarchy obey orders that means that's a pressure not to refuse that means that if you feel the gut feeling of this is wrong i need to refuse it's obviously the specific cases where you should refuse the order right that means that you're going to save a life in that specific case but only if you have the the training that to fortify your gut your gut feeling to tell you what to do and to give you the legal protection against retribution in this case which is what happens under the motion now what happens in the day after the motion uh after we refuse this systematic change of a by by the mechanism trial and doing away with those bad apples we get now the reveal to the media to the bad actors and their bad practices that oh oh so desperately not the comparative here in status quo you have internal investigation by internal affairs that are run by the police like internally uh uh and that's true for a lot of countries these things are not transparent and you have a huge incentive to uh uh um clear the name of the officers that perform the police brutality because these are people you know you have the money the reputation of the precinct to consider and the city and pressure from your superior offices there's a culture of loyalty the thin blue line that exists in any police force and also the the fear of the police officer to report because they're uncomplex that means that for framing that's not only for the u.s but not the tension in oo's case they say they talk about uh systematic problems that they say themselves mostly only exist in the u.s our case doesn't depend on that but even if you only fix things in the u.s we think that's a huge uh benefit to our debate what happens in trials before that let's take ceo who do you think that are able to make a decision about to use the use of violence or not someone who has been biased by his own experiences or someone who is highly educated has political accountability and has the incentive to be liked by the voters what's your delta here eventually the police officer will still have to make the decision that's symmetrical in this debate we prefer well where they have more of that training than the opposite where you don't have in your world let's talk about trials the police officer refused the order is now a witness in two different trials he's a prosecution witness in the police brutality trial against the police officer that gave the order and performed the brutality and he's a defense uh witness in the trial of the suspect that was arrested brutally that won't happen otherwise because that police officer won't come forward because of his fear because he's an accomplice because he's protected behind the thin blue line and he hasn't performed the mental leap of i need to report this this is bad i need to happen this happens in our world now you have the public exposure of bad officers and they're doing away this and bad lead and bad commanders but also you have the public exposure of bad procedures because the prosecutor is going to ask that officer at on the stand why were you put in that spot why were you told to do this thing what is your departmental policy in these cases exposing all these kind of things that don't come to the public any other way also as another mechanism to that you get more other policemen refusing the the order because they saw the bravery and personal example of that singular officer this leads to more and more in a positive circle and there's no um deterrent against that that you see from the others now that means that we are now able to purge the bad apples to purge the bad uh procedures and have the systemic change that we simply don't get any other way specifically is specifically not in the status quo that ox are defending and therefore we are so so proud to propose this motion thank the speaker for that speech and now to begin the extension for side opposition we welcome the member of opposition here here can you hear me perfect so all right three two one panel opening opposition once more scrutiny on the structural issues in the police force the problem is that they set up a massively high burden of proof for themselves namely that those ingrained issues are now suddenly going to be solved at the moment this narrative slightly changes uh uh and they're uh and that therefore the the changes that need to be so significant in order to really do anything about the problems can really have impacts i don't think they prove that within this debate we're going to do it the other way around we're not going to say that there's necessarily going to be significantly more scrutiny to the level that the problems at the structures are going to be changed now we're saying that the liberalization of individual police officers is the most likely thing to lead to more police violence as you normalize and accept the idea that individual police officers are the right ones to make the judgment calls in in situations note that when the police officer i don't know his name put his knee on the neck of george flory floyd he was not following an order right he was racist and he thought he could do what he wanted we think police brutality although widespread like opening opposition says is a problem that exists in the individual police officer who is not trained and who is often racist therefore we think giving them more freedom to act upon their own decisions is likely to lead to more problems that is how we are going to win this debate from closing opposition today before that let me quickly do a few points of response note that opening opposition says that there is less scrutiny on the structure of the police i think there are two issues that they need to prove that they didn't at the end of this debate first of all i don't know why that scrutiny would become so significantly more right in some individual case of a police officer internally there might be a little bit of change sometimes a media article might be slightly differently written i don't think that proves that there will be significant change we think the police doesn't uh those problems at the top of the police are difficult to solve because people don't want to for example give money to uh to give spend money in order to improve the police force because a majority of the population doesn't even think in the first place that problems in the police force exist and think that uh that it's currently fine and that people and and because the problems are so significant therefore i think they don't necessarily prove that um second of all i think it is their burden of proof it is enough to overcome the ingrained power that currently exists in the police i don't think they do that so at the end of the day although i think their idea is smart their impact is just relatively marginal at best closing government says now we're gonna get better training but this is their entire case is also reliant on that idea that that better training would happen that much right we think their mechanisms aren't necessarily better than those of opening opposition which means probably it will fall somewhere in the middle it's kind of a wash nothing will really happen but second of all note that at the moment they don't necessarily prove that training will that significantly improve because no cure lead is really bad currently all their impacts fall the other way right because then you are giving them freedom but without the ability in order to fulfill that freedom we're going to explain why giving them this freedom is something that is incredibly bad to do note that following an order not following an order can mean lots of different things it can also mean shooting despite someone telling you to disengage because you think that it is a situation in which is it absolutely necessary from your own moral perspective for example to save someone else or for example to help your fellow cop those are also things no thank you that mean not following orders it also means for example not helping someone who is asking for help because you think that is something that you shouldn't be doing at that point in time why do we think that that the problem at the individual level of the police officer is the biggest problem and therefore giving them more liberty is something that is a very bad idea note that opening opposition explains that orders are sometimes problematic due to issues at the top we think that that is true however we think the issues at the bottom and the individual police officer are even larger for three reasons first of all they have much less training and much less experience right which means they are much more reliant on on sort of limited information limited knowledge limited skills in order to be making decisions we think people at the top also have an incentive to avoid certain scandals which means probably they can make better decisions about what is less likely to lead to scams or to issues than people at the bottom second of all we think people at the bottom are more likely to be racist for three reasons first of all they are generally less educated and from a poorer background than the people at the top which unfortunately correlates with being more racist second of all we think these people are less publicly scrutinized and less too held to account by society which means that they have the more the ability to be racist and third of all we think they are way more exposed to the things that radicalize cops and often make them racist for example violence or black neighbors with a lot of crime or something those are often things that make police officers at the bottom more more likely to be racist because they have to encounter them every day third of all we think they're in a much more urgent situation than the people in the office at the top which means they are less rational and more reliant on their intuitions and their instincts in order to make judgment calls those are more likely to be your biases than the people at the top who can think about it rationalize about it discuss about it and then give the order why then do we so therefore we think that the people at the bottom are significantly more likely to be racist and make racism bad decisions that that lead to worse outcomes than the people at the top why will this lead to the liberalization of police officers first of all this narrative requires the underlying assumption that a police officer one is the only one who can truly know what the right choice is in a certain situation and second of all is someone who has the ability to make this decision in the best possible way and better than anyone else second of all this legitimizes the idea that a police officer acting beyond the scope of their authority can be something that is legitimate what is the result of these underlying things that this uh this idea this policy justifies first what we say it is much more internalized by police officers the day they start with their training and the day they come into the police force that they are ultimately the one who can make their decisions and that that is fine instead of that they have to listen to other things therefore they themselves internalize the idea that they can make the right decision can deviate from those orders we think that is bad because they are worse actors for making those choices second of all we think these things are also pushed through the accountability mechanisms rather than the sheer fact and the status quo that deviating from the order is enough to fire you or to sue you in court there is now the extra necessity to prove that that individual didn't make a decision based on his own moral conscience and didn't have justification for making that conscience therefore we also think that holding these individuals accountable significantly harder and that is also what og wants right because they want to not fire these people that deviate from the norms panel i'm incredibly proud to oppose thank the speaker for that speech and now to conclude for site government we welcome the web speaker here here [Music] no worries it's happened to all of us very proud to be here i'm going to start in three two one closing closing opposition tell us that the officer that lied on george floyd wasn't filling orders this ignores the fact that first of all this was the commanding officer in the scene ordering the three other men to lie online on top of them secondly that there are uh police protocols that actually guided this kind of misguided behavior three points uh two points in my speech first of all where do we get more systematic change secondly why is systematic change of police brutality the biggest uh uh impact in this debate before that a few points of extraneous rebuttal first of all they tell us a closing uh opposition tell us we're not going to get better uh better guidance under our site better training to uh officers this just ignores all of the analysis that talks about why this is in the interest of of police stations to show that this is part of the communal help and stuff like that why when you give officers the right to actually deny and and go against an order you actually need to explain to them which situations this happens in then they tell us a lot of situations they're going to deny orders to shoot and decide to shoot someone out of the black we just think this isn't likely because we already explained to you why the training is more focused on denying violence and stuff like that because in a lot of situations if they feel danger they are allowed to shoot note even if they don't have a uh a clear a clear command but now we explain to them why when they do have a command they they don't have to do it if they don't feel endangered if they don't feel that this is the right thing so we just get more of this under our side because of this communal responsibility secondly we just believe that the training to police officers are really really long we can make them longer if it's like the mechanistic problem closing our position tells they don't get enough of trainings but lastly regarding the fact that police officers have more racism throughout time first of all we already answered what kind of morals people have in kicking in the scene and each and every officer knows how to assess all these things but two other responses first of all there is no delta right they're not talking about any other actor in the motion uh by the motion that says that these are commands we're talking about their commander giving them these commands which is ad which is as biased as all these police officers because he is experiencing all the same problems that they are describing day by day so we just think honestly that under our side that under this side there is no change on when a lot of this happens today and lastly our case deals with this right because once not all the police officers are as racist as people in the kkk game they actually feel some pain inside when they're meeting up when they see someone beat up then these are people that are much more likely to uh report other people and be in the trial that we talk about we just get more systematic change why is this true note at this point closing our position doesn't have a standing case we should be above them opening opposition tell us that there are problematic systematic problems that you don't discover note a you why why do they tell us first of all the media note that you don't change the media narrative in any way right a lot of situations these uh uh these people are already filmed and they are already uh uh accused by the media because it is uh much more liberal than a lot of the police officers we honestly don't understand why there is delta secondly they tell us look police officers are just going to throw responsibility down the line first of all you need to know that if an order was given then the police officer that denied the order is not the one responsible the the officer that actually went after the order is responsible this just means that the order is the problem as well in this situation so this doesn't change how much responsibility changes in this situation secondly this assumes that when something happens the officers that listen to an order will be the one responsible and not the ones above him lastly if people just deny more orders we just believe this is less protect police brutality and that's better but moreover we tell you um moreover we have bigger impacts than this opening opposition tell us there's not going to be systematic change because now we're not going to know that there are bigger problems first of all we just show you why there are a lot more cases that are revealed under our site this means that there is a lot more information how is this happening few things first of all once this police officer is a a witness from the defense in the uh arrest crowd someone who was beaten up this just means that now we have information uh um because this police officer needs to report himself as someone that denied an order and didn't want to do this in the first place this just means that a lot of situations we're going to have so much more information about what happened in the scene and be able to now know how to make all these changes secondly when we tell you that this there are going to be a prosecution witness against the trial this just shows you a lot of situations um why why are they going to do this first of all because they were in the scene secondly because the one that's the ones that are hurt from police brutality are going to look for them all the ngos will want to do this lastly there are videos showing this police officer actually denying this order this means that they're going to be summoned to court when this happens what does this prove to you this proves to you that the more we have uh more and more people uh reporting all this stuff we have just much more evidence which leads to much more public outright because we know that now police officers are felt guilty lastly we just say they are much more likely police officers are much more likely to get into jail before i explain that um openly if cgs incentives for better training which is what they rely on to get people to actually refuse orders exist then they exist on our side of the house and they can already implement systemic changes anyway the difference is they reduce incentive to report off to the fact this is no no no no no they can't refuse an order because then they would be prosecuted because they are guilty under your side for being accomplices under our side they are nuts this means that they have every reason to report this now open government tells there are situations where police officers are going to go against violence we explain to you something much larger first of all why each case of police brutality just leads to future prevention why first of all because you accused the offensive officer you kicked them out of the police because now they have you have a trial and people people are witnesses this means that we just get this police officer not uh not uh offending other people secondly because we change the entire system because when we have this training when we have a lot of more information we're much more able to know the exact s changes that we want to do why is this the biggest problem in this debate opening opposition tell us look there are a lot of other alternatives right first of all note that when we have uh internal affairs or or legal sanctions against this person or loyalty then we're not able to prosecute all these officers we actually show you why this changes because now they have the incentive to report them lastly all the alternatives of diversifying the police it's really hard to accomplish this in each and every place in the country we just believe that this is inefficient honestly we're really happy thank the speaker on the whole of the government bench and now to conclude for the opposition on the whole of the debate we'd like to welcome the opposition web speaker here here in the majority of countries putting your knee on someone's neck is banned because it is excessive violence no matter what you do in the majority of countries you're not allowed to shoot first because that is something that puts citizens in danger the problem we face today is not that the commands given aren't good is that police officers refuse to listen to them under our side of the house we can hold them to account we don't empower them to fall into their racist biases and we can fire them that is something that all leaves on our propositions case i think the problem is they pretend that individual police officers are better able to make decisions than commanding officers are i think that is ridiculous what i'm going to talk about today is one i'm going to talk about the general police force what happens there which i actually think is awash in the majority of the debate but two i'm going to talk about how we think that there is going to be more good orders refused by bad police officers than bad orders refused by good police officers so comparing um so on to what happens to the justice system i think that comparing ourselves from opening opposition there is simply no comparative on their side of the house listen the reason people were upset about george floyd wasn't because we felt like individual police officers called certain demands because everyone saw a seven minute video of someone telling police officers i can't breathe calling for his mother and then people in office officers uniforms continuing to put their knee on their neck i think accountability like that on the system is going to happen on their boat side of the house under our side of the house however we can say that was against uh guidelines that was against commands that is not something you should do so i think that mainly all of the justice system is just simply a wash especially since miriam does a great job at explaining why training is not a sexy topic it doesn't become more sexy when people aren't actually uh can't object according to their consciousness stuff so i think that that means o is out of the debate then when it comes to closing government when they say we can reveal the bad apples and kick them out here's the important thing here revealing the bad apples means that they have to make very bad decisions two responses one we can also reveal bad apples because racist policy goes and makes commands goes against guidelines goes against everything you should do which means we can fire you under your side of the house it's more difficult to fire bad apples as david has explained to you because those bad apples are empowered to make individual decisions because you as a police officer on the ground are the one person who can make this life or death decision your commanding officers know the training of cg has told you for many many years that your commanding officer is not someone you should listen to that much because your individual thinking skills are so important bad apples are more likely to get away with it under their side of the house okay moving on to the actual most important thing is there going to be more police violence more brutality i think what god explains to you is the issues in the police are not an issue at the top but they're an issue at the bottom one whilst difficult it is easier to hold people to account at the top than it is to hold them account to the to to the bottom right i think that those are not the people who are going to be in the media those are the people who have to defend themselves those are not the people you actually know that doesn't mean that there's not systematic issues in the police it means there's fewer systematic issues and there's fewer racism at the top then there actually is at the bottom two that explains to you that there it is far more likely that these people are highly educated cg then says uh but we'll do training and we'll like make training really hard i'm sorry i think one training is such a boring topic that literally no one wants to fund that i don't think that has anything to do with the responsibility we give people i'm sorry we give police officers a  gun they're able to shoot people i think that means we have an incentive to fund people but they're still underfunded so i think on their side of the house they're going to have a trading which says you should make your own decisions but then they never actually get any sort of like training and never get the ability to make decisions then lastly what david tells you is the police officers are extremely biased you parole in the most poor neighborhoods you parole in the neighborhoods with minorities your commander does not your commander in the majority of countries is very likely to come in via a different stream if we all would apply to a police officer to like the police academy very often you would be trained to become a commander not necessarily someone who patrols on the street i think that means that they are far more so i think that those commanders never had that experience they're far less likely to be biased i think too given the fact that you now are more likely to lose your partner or feel violent or be beaten up something like that i think that increases bias and a confirmation bias under arson of the house i think police officers are trained to continuously make quick judgment decisions based on their gut feeling that gut feeling is bad under our side of the house you don't have to make a decision based on your gut feeling because your commanding officer has told you what to do and has given you the guidelines those guidelines are far more likely to be good than racist which is something under their side of the house closing government response to that by saying you still have to make decisions on their both side of the house two responses one i think there's way less wiggle room look i think in the majority of cases you're being told parole in this particular neighborhood check every tenth car you see for drugs on the downside of the house if you feel like talking to a black person first and only checking out black cars you're able to do it because you're told you know more than your commanding officer you know better than your commanding officer you're the individual that can make that decision you're more likely to listen though those types of guidelines and there's less wiggle room but two i think in very often there's going to be direct commands do not engage do not you do not use lethal force that doesn't happen i'll take a py from opening government vast majority of orders are given by your immediate superior or small local police chiefs those are by our own analysis and responded to people who just made it through the police longer and were selected by older people who also presumably did not have the most progressive values why are their decisions good okay so i think one most countries have national guidelines and like national leaders right i don't think this is about the us where you can simply go rogue but i think too you're still far more likely to have commanding officers at a higher level right state levels do have commanding officers which go down i think thirdly given the fact that you do make some sort of a promotion your farmer likes to be held to account than anything that happens under there so it's a house where individual police officers at least now get the best police officers making the best decision comparing us directly against opening government opening government tries to claim that very few people will actually refuse and there's oh this will only happen in extreme cases this goes again directly against their entire analysis in cap which was quite great which is that people will will be feel empowered to make individual decisions and they'll think that they are the ones that are ultimately held responsible the issue is that even if police officers feel individual responsibility that doesn't mean that they make the best decisions they'll feel responsibility to then make the best decision and to make a judgment call to do something they feel good at but what david explains to you is that what police officers feel good at is usually not the right thing we want to politicize orders we want the black lives matter movement to have influence over orders we want them to be able to hold the police to account that's something that doesn't happen on their side of the house opening government then says you can only order more violence not less i think that's you can tell them you have to use different steps in escalation you cannot use legal force that happens under our side of the house look i think this is a debate about who's best able to make decisions i think individual police officers are horrible at making decisions we should limit their ability to make these decisions that crazy ask you to oppose we thank the speaker for that speech and indeed everyone for a fantastic wait once again congratulations to all teams for having made the eudc open final um so yeah hope everyone enjoyed the debate and i guess the judges and i will deliver it and results will be announced in this time
