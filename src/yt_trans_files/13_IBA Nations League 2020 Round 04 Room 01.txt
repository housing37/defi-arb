Video Motion: THR the belief that forgiveness is a virtue

Video Title: IBA Nations League 2020 Round 04 Room 01

Transcript:
 so so just a moment just gonna pull up there so on the motion that this house regrets the narrative that forgiveness is virtue eric no i'm all good um yes thank you we welcome the prime minister to open this debate sure you can still hear me yep oh sorry it's complaining again okay every person who is asked to forgive something is by definition a victim what we want to tell you from opening government is that the norm that tells people that you should aspire to forgive people and that it's a virtue is something that a prevents people from getting the sort of closure on important instances that they need and be one that disproportionately favors people who are already privileged and advantaged at the disfavor of people who genuinely need more support and need more avenue to express the things that have been done to them i want to clarify a few things before we get started we should think in this debate about what exactly this norm manifests as like how is it conveyed in society and what are some of the consequences of it i think there are a few things that are important first of all the notion that forgiveness of a virtue goes above and beyond the notion that you should not say pursue a vendetta or let like vengeance or rage consume you if someone has done you wrong it is like a positive notion that it is like aspirational and a good thing if you can forgive someone above and beyond where someone might still be able to hold some facet of a grudge and the way that it's reflected in society is very representative of this we have things like you know like to er as human to forgive divine it's lauded you know we talk about people there's often positive cultural pressure on you you want to preserve the family unit at the sake of not forgetting to because people want to preserve you like units or structures of organization they care about above and beyond simply letting one person suffering go and importantly i think that it tends to work against vulnerable individuals for a very specific reason because when there is a norm that you should forgive it tends to get leveraged in the favor of people who people want to defend or like anyway that typically tends to be privileged people disadvantage saying why won't you forgive me or use it being able to leverage that against the powerful it works fundamentally in the opposite direction because that norm is applied specifically against the people who are unable to defend themselves and it's in the defense of people who want an act i'm going to talk about two things first of all why this is bad for individuals and second of all so the immoral outcomes the result first question i want to ask about individuals is do we think that people currently do not forget forgive others where they should by and large no i think there's positive pressure that all of us would have experienced to not make a scene would have been told that you should just let it go it's good for you to move on and that like just observing the world around us i don't think there's like an epidemic of people who are pursuing vendettas problem beyond what they need to so who does this norm actually harm in that context first of all it harms you because they feel a positive obligation in instances where they're not ready to forgive someone but this norm tells them that you should aspire to that and maybe they come to the moment where they give a public forget public instance of forgiveness well they would not otherwise be before they fully explore their feelings or have the time to reconsider because of often that pressure like the pressure for that is a temporal with when the moment in time exists where you actually feel forgiveness and very importantly often this forgiveness is pressured to come before the fact where all of the details or relevant instances so come to life so what that means is that maybe after you've got all the full details about who the person who traumatized you was and their behavior in the past you would not feel they're worthy of forgiveness or you'd want more pressure to be leveraged against them because there's this positive pressure to get that forgiveness out of the way as part of the healing process that means that you give that instance of forgiveness and once that is done it is difficult to unwind it because often it's associated with like public instances of saying like i'll shake your hand i forgive you it's okay we move on and once you've done that it's less acceptable to go back to it because people will tell you you're revisiting something you've got over you just need to move past it you said it was okay let's go on i think it would be better if we lived in a world that we did not perceive to be a virtue if people came to that organically and absorbed their own nature it would be a good thing in some instances but there's not an expectation that will you do so second of all i think there is pressure leveraged on vulnerable people for the reason there's an expectation that if you don't forgive you're doing a bad thing one of the corollaries of people lording this sort of thing is that it's sort of like a virtuous to not forgive people it means you have some deficit you're not able to get over your problems or you're particularly spiteful and this is a particular thing that has eaten people who don't want to lie for pre-existing reasons such as minorities such as women things that we would have seen play out again and again and say the workplace where they say she's just a spiteful  or something like that when a man would have been given far more credibility to have those sorts of feelings and what this necessarily does is it hurts people who are victims and people who should carry on these instances but b often forces them to very public displays of forgiveness that often be hurt from them because they're forced to reconcile all the people who have hurt them and maybe continue to engage in public instances or be around them for instance for family member that has abused you or done to make bad you or you would not otherwise want to do so because there's this positive pressure to just get over it for the sake of a broader collective unit and they use the fact that forgiveness is virtue as a way of leveraging this power second of all i want to note that this means there's pressure not to stand up for yourself it means that where you would otherwise be more willing to stand up and say this person doesn't seem punished but they're a bad person i want people to acknowledge this you're more pressured to say i'm going to forgive them you view it as something that you personally have to reconcile rather than a problem that they need to be held accountable for for this reason the third thing i think that it's important is that it doesn't sorry okay second point why this is asymmetrically applied so i think an important observation is oh sorry  okay this is the the last thing i wanted to talk about is that it removes the spectrum that like the the range of sort of things that exist within the realm of forgiveness right so forgiveness is by this notion of this very fine thing like you have the moment where you forgive someone and you get over it and then you've like cast the water clean like you move on from that instance i think that forgiveness and exploring how you feel about a bad thing that is done to you really be a more complicated thing maybe you're willing to move past and you can tolerate them you don't want to completely absolve them for the wrong they've done and you certainly don't want to go to the point where you think i'm done with that instance but the notion that it is a virtue and something you should aspire to often encourages people to take this in totality they say i have forgiven you this thing is complete we'd rather people have more time and granularity to explore the range of things or how they feel about the particular instance i'll take closing surely if your contention is that forgiveness kind of happens at the right level now that would be because the norm and the virtue exists and is the status quo i don't think that anything i've said that pretends that like the current level of forgiveness is too much most of me saying that like far too far too heavily especially against disadvantaged people the second thing i want to talk about is how this is asymmetrically applied as i have alluded to any norm that says you should forgive someone or it allows you to put pressure on someone who has been the victim of a particular instance is almost identically going to be leveraged disproportionately against disadvantaged people for the reason that they are aimed more likely to have been pressured or had bad things done to them by people who are from a higher position in society and there they are less likely to fight less able to fight back against that cultural expectation and pressure as in where it exists what this means is that this norm in so far this exists becomes cover people who are more privileged and more powerful to do bad things it is like almost in some respects like a fundamental part of the thing that says like if a woman has been like abused or a bad thing has been done by a powerful man it is like part of the narrative that goes into like you should forgive this person especially if they're a family member or someone that is close to you now this means that this norm insofar as it is a tool that can be leveraged in this way is simply a tool to prevent people from speaking up getting full credibility and like you know like the sort of closure they actually deserve for these instances and it's covered people who do that thing they don't regret their actions because they can leverage the fact this person should be willing to forgive them in order to get better i do not think that people by and large absent this norm would like go to war and like wage 15-year battles over like a wrong gun than 15 years ago more likely it would have a world which people felt more comfortable not having their like someone who did wrong to them in a public scenario with them and would make them more likely to speak out about the things that were done to them that's why we propose thank you we now welcome the leader of opposition can you hear me yep okay starting in three two um starting in three two one uh the first thing i'd like to clarify is this this is a narrative that we uniformly apply as a state across the board obviously how it is interpreted by people is up for debate but it is not going to be selectively applied i.e will try to push it down majorities as much as possible using mainstream media using education systems as much as we can with that being said um just a couple of pieces of framing not necessarily directly with og but just undercut closing i think this debate is primarily about interpersonal interactions any macro argument that closing tries to run is irrelevant because macro perspectives are based on what people want that eventually relate to the state and their decisions so anything that we talk about is clearly the most important thing in this debate with that being said three things i'll talk about in my speech first why human beings naturally don't want to forgive and even with the existence of this narrative the forgiveness is rare second why do we believe this narrative is something that empowers minorities rather than disempowers them thirdly we think that even if minorities get closure from them that closure is minimal but the utilitarian harm to them is massive first there are three structural reasons why humans naturally don't want to forgive number one they're emotional beings they have hormones and they over exaggerate situations in their heads especially unless someone gives them a counter narrative or a reality check number two there's societal triggers and especially internal triggers such as memories that continuously remind them of a particular incident the moment that it has passed and that make sure that it continues to haunt them to the end of their lives number three oftentimes they're powerful people who use these triggers in society in order to gain power that's why we have hate politics that's why we have the politics of envy the reason why they do this is because it's a lot easier to select to people than it is to sell rational discourse that you often have to compete against all groups equally whereas hate often guarantees self-conventing certain groups in order to gain power the conclusion is forgiveness is really rare evidence of this is the fact that we have tough on crime policies right now despite this being a virtue because people want vengeance people want to get rid of a lot of the frustrations they have in their lives evidence of this is the fact that there's a lottery that we see due to the rise of the right-wing across the world therefore assuming that this narrative is applied it's applied due to two number one it's applied when there's a certain degree of criteria of compensation met or apology i.e someone seeking forgiveness has to really bend down and seek apology and address their guilt in order to get that apology because it's not something that can naturally be gotten secondly for you to forgive someone you often don't forget that the incident happened but you let go of the rage you let go of the fact that you connect that person to that incident but often overcome the incident itself and look at the utilitarian perspective of remembering that incident happened but not hating that person for it and using it for utilitarian gain why is this very crucial first we think human beings are more prone to mistake due to deterministic factors rather than free will what do i mean by this most decisions you make in your life are either by virtue of the societal context you live in which is if you're born into a poor family or if you're born into say a neighborhood in detroit you're more likely to join a gang number two it's often due to the arbitrariness of your upbringing the way in which you're indoctrinated whether you get a good education whether or not you have the hormones to control the extent of your rage therefore this is simple most of this applies more to minorities they're more prone to making mistakes that people will want forgiveness for number two the judge mistakes is based on morality i.e the majority of morality and what is right and what is wrong is also shaped by majorities so whether or not a minority opts into that is also something up for debate the conclusion is most people that need forgiveness in society are minorities themselves not majorities directly removing the frame of opening government uh why do we think this is important in order for minorities number one we think there's a principal moral perspective here i.e unless you ask them to forgive there's a greater chance of most minorities being excluded from society rather than majorities themselves secondly the utilitarian perspective is you fracture to society and tilt it towards those who are privileged number one is if the majority are emotional you often make them hate identities more than the person themselves i.e if they're hated uh or if they've faced injustice by one african-american they over trump the rationality behind that incident because they haven't forgiven it and they connect that to all african americans number two they often limit their interactions with these people because they can't forgive them i.e there's less incentive for them to include these minorities number three they often use their positions of power to entrench the kinds of privileges they have far more so the first piece of framing is the people that need forgiveness are those in the minorities we harm them let's say that the people in the majorities do a lot of evil and the minorities are the one that forgive even in that training why do we win but before that i'll take closing how much wrong do you think minorities do to majorities and how much contro they have over the narrative of virtue of forgiveness what i just told you is number one minorities do do most wrongs based on morality and interpersonal interaction i don't think anyone cares about the 1700s anymore and colonial paths if there's a degree of how much you feel hurt by the fact that you have short time lapse in it number two is even if majorities do hurt the fact that minorities are excluded allows them to weaponize that emotions which is part of that analysis anyway even if you don't buy these two layers of analysis thirdly even if a minority is a victim not forgiving really doesn't get much number one we think the closure is just minimal uh let's say you have rage let's say you have anger all of these are lots of negative emotions that often make you feel like it's not a positive feeling so whether or not you collectivize and get utilitarian benefit is very circumspect even in the best case scenario of og most social movements take generations to succeed the fact that they live with this rage and anger forever is a perpetual negative feeling that they never get over so even if you get something it's quite minimal at least from the individual perspective secondly we think that assuming rage and anger collectivize people this is the worst form of collectivization for social movements number one rage cannot be centralized the moment you have raged every single person has their own story and their own sought for vengeance so you can collectivize people into achieving one common goal based on the utilitarian memory of it rather than the rage associated with seeking vengeance number two rage often means people do not compromise which means they want complete compensation for every single incident that happened so you don't get intersectional collectivization in movements where people have different struggles of different degrees collectivize for a compromised self-interest number three rage can often be misconstrued by majorities this is because the moment one person is rage or attacking them that they're you're saying that they should feel guilt and you're saying that their every single part of the majority is responsible rather than asking them to feel empathy the moment they feel attacked there's a very easy way for the powerful individuals to get away with the political narrative of saying these people are extremists these people are terrorists none of their power is justified and none of what they want is important best case examples um taliban i think what they want is really interesting the fact that they're raging about it makes the west literally want to kill them uh the fact that hamas has risen from palestine removes all the reasons why palestine deserves their land and that's how the rage of a particular community can be weaponized by specific groups in order to disempower them so even if it's a minorities you don't get win thank you we now welcome the deputy prime minister hello let me just get my timer out somewhere i can see them okay sorry before you start am i the only one who for whom the volume is a bit low yeah i can't hear anything either oh okay maybe matt you can speak up i was actually fine but i think maybe speak up yeah i couldn't hear anything though uh slightly better i think now yeah this is very nice okay all right okay okay a few things in this speech firstly i want to highlight one or two very important things i think went unresponded to secondly i'll talk about that counterframe of sort of hate then i'll talk about asymmetry and lastly i'll talk about the sin of neutrality because we think the big thing that they missed is what forgiveness actually entails the expectation that you forgive they say that this requires condition we think the opposite we think forgiveness reinforces the status quo we think that is precisely the thing that keeps minorities down we want change we don't think the alternative is hate we think it is progress so uh firstly important thing that john talks about the knowledge responded to which is the general set of arguments as to why this does lead to an overwhelming positive pressure in favor of forgiveness above and beyond that which people would normally want to now they did respond a little bit with the kind of weird biological essentialism stuff which is like all humans are naturally emotional have societal triggers and powerful people want to make them hate and as pointed out before we don't think that hate is the corollary to not forgiving we don't think the alternative to forgiving someone is hating them forever it's saying i am not ready to go back for neutrality on you i think you have done something bad and i think some meaningful action needs to be taken before i can move past this the pressure to forgive is one which is absolute is to say that there is a positive virtue in saying look maybe something happened maybe something was bad we need to get on and move past it we don't need to reopen those wounds and re-examine who did what who said what who did this what can be done about it we just want to forgive and move past it for all the reasons that john gave because there are because there's a positive incentive on third parties if i'm the company hr board i don't want to have to do mediation i don't want to get sued i just want everyone to just sit in a room and be like look we all forgive each other do i care if those people deep down have actually forgiven each other not necessarily but i want big public displays of forgiveness so i can move past it and push everything under the rug and not actually change any of my corporate policies that have led to this kind of toxic behavior um manifesting in this place because it's seen as equivocal because the positive benefit of being someone who has forgiven someone is seen as a form of reparation maybe something was bad bad happened to you but now you've forgiven them you get sort of positive feeling of being the person who is forgiven and therefore everything is treated as good i also think the last thing on biological essentialism to point out is that like it's just like a very poor reading of basically all apology which is just the inverse which is that humans have evolved from social animals there's obviously a giant evolutionary benefit to being able to forgive to being basically altruistic which is why humans are able to move past things like all animals have this capacity to fight each other and nearly kill each other over food and then two minutes later be friends and mutually groom it anyway so i don't think that is the corollary i think the more compelling that like what they're actually doing is misconstruing a drive to sort of ferment hatred with one to not forgive which i think is entirely opposite right the hatred of for example illegal immigrants or refugees no one is being like forgive the refugees people are saying no you should you know treat them with some basic human dignity because you're creating a fundamentally different set of circumstances to judge these actions or not not like have they done something directly harmful for me do i need to forgive them that's not the issue it's the illusion of things like competition between these races between different groups that's what creates this kind of hatred stuff that they're talking about and i don't think there is a meaningful like push of forgiveness is what is going to solve all of this stuff so next on asymmetry why is this important because um their stance they had a weird sense of like oh we support like a state not asymmetrically applying at norm which is obviously nonsense because you know norms are applied by individual people who have biases in the way that they apply them and it's not a policy debate the point here is that when they say things like the majority shapes morality and minorities are the ones that need forgiveness they're missing the point they're missing the solution the solution is not to say well morality is inherently racist so i guess we'll just see forgiveness no the solution is to change morality to change the standards by which we judge people's actions and even with their own logic honestly like just makes no  sense right they're like minorities are like the people who need forgiveness what do you want about minorities are overwhelming the victims of society women are overwhelmingly the victims of society african americans are overwhelmingly the victims of the entire american project it is absurd to suggest that these are the people who in the general sense need forgiveness what actually happens here is that when they do have legitimate grievances when these people say look what this government is doing is bad to me what the police are doing to me is bad everyone's like look guys just forgive and forget don't worry about it it was a mistake it's fine you're a woman oh well you know just turn the other cheek just move on how many microaggressions do people have to tolerate on a daily basis how many times do women get layered at touched inappropriately be the victims of sexual assault and told to just up and deal with it because that's the morally correct things to do don't shake the boat forgive and forget and move past them and it's precisely because these people are overwhelmingly the victims it's precisely because the other things john said that went unresponded to about we have a perception of who we should forgive when we see someone who generally thought of as like i think about how many terrible debate men who um have been accused very publicly of sexual assault and people like oh no but it's fine because you know he was in a world's final so i guess we like him not naming names but uh the point here is that when people have other axes of social credibility they're able to leverage that to get positive pressure towards being forgiven this is john's argument that went unresponded to the end result is i think minorities overwhelmingly in the status quo pressured to forgive people even when they don't want to and they say the impact of being made to forgive when you don't believe it is not that big which i think you know trivializes and diminishes a lot of the ptsd and real trauma that these people suffer but more meaningfully delegitimize is what they then ask in the future the other part of john's argument that we weren't unresponded to if i'm a young woman who is told to forgive and forget when i'm 16 and 17 and don't really understand what happens and then a few years down the line i'm like wow that you know that actually was sexual assault now i can't bring it up against my family because i'll say wait you forgive you you forgave that person you forgot you moved past it why are you bringing up all these old wounds these are exactly the kind of things that keep minorities down lastly then on the sin of neutrality and why the perception of forgiveness allows unrelated third parties to reinforce the status quo by not investing themselves in this before that poi from closing got anything otherwise opening okay so the narrative already exists in society despite that we've given you evidence to believe that some people don't forgive purely that shows that the structural incentives of people are naturally to not forgive what's to believe whatever you're claiming that there are some people who presently don't forgive doesn't mean that there is not an overwhelming bias in favor of forgiveness in society right that just makes no sense um anyway we also gave you many structural reasons why particular groups of people do have an over emphasis to forgive so quickly then on the last thing of neutrality the problem here is that it's very easy when i have the third option of instead of taking a side in a binary dispute two of my friends one man one woman the man's been accused of sexual assault do i have to take meaningful sides on behalf of this action and pressure my male friend to do something better no i can take the third option and be like look guys i am staying out of it i am being neutral i'm not being perceived of apathetic because i have an opinion on the matter which is that it would be better for everyone to forgive to move past which is a convenient thing for me which allows me to not challenge any of my prejudices and internal beliefs it doesn't force me to confront difficult situations and to try and take an active stance to do this it is precisely the kind of thing that when we abstract it to politics is why martin luther king complains about the issue of the white moderate because people are able to abstract themselves and say this is not a thing that matters to me anymore i can take the moral high ground by telling everyone to forgive each other and i do not need to change anything about the system that is what keeps minorities down don't accept the system and beg for forgiveness try and make meaningful change opening government thank you we now welcome deputy leader of opposition can you guys hear me yep excellent okay so first things first um who is in a position to forgive i think side og is a bit dismissive when it says oh it's you know obviously it's the victims our minorities and so on and so forth i think that completely strawman's what the actual reality is we are not suggesting that women cause more suffering to men what we are instead suggesting is that the way society is structured the way narratives are created means that the people in power are often more in positions where they consider whether to forgive or not how so for instance whether when deciding for example criminal policies that it extrude has extraordinary amount of consequences on african americans for example in the united states and income and it affects incarceration rates for them how it affects is for example you may not believe they deserve forgiveness but the people the white middle class often do believe that it's a matter of whether or not you can forgive the way in which black people are protesting in order to address their concerns in the first place right so overwhelmingly often the most powerful actors are often in positions whether they consider a question of forgiveness or not and that is where this narrative is extraordinarily important because if they are able to say we don't forgive and act out in that sense then minorities and people who suffer have absolutely no chance of being able to fight the system in the first place i think that in itself takes out everything opening government has said so far because they haven't actually dealt with what happens when there's an added incentive structures for the oppressors to to then uh tackle down on minorities even more but second then they came up and said you know this means that minorities won't speak up and that's really bad i just have a lot of responses to this first of all i think it's extraordinarily condescending to just say oh because these narratives exist like minorities were oppressed just you know forget about what happened to them and never speak up in the first place and i just don't think that's realistic in the sense that they themselves then also go on to concede that even if you push this narrative down that is something that deep do deep within them that does simmer that does simmer means that there is an incentive for them to always pick up at some point or the other which means there's some form of coalition at all the while going on but the third thing to say is that i think they have conflated forgiveness with forgetting right and i think this is also something they've forgotten which is that there's an alternative uh that the forgiveness narrative does not mean that you also forget because it's also forgive but not forget right that is also a narrative that is coupled with this narrative in the first place which is that there for you to say i forgive you as a person for what you have done i forgive you as a community for what you have done but that does not mean that the redress that is required for the current inequalities goes away because you can still address current concerns without saying that this person personally needs to be punished in some form of another you don't need to be vying for revenge in order to seek redress we think this is fundamentally different things that opening government has massively conflated in this debate and the final thing that i really want to point out the huge conflation that takes them out because i think they've tried to get away in this debate by talking about how minorities are often suppressed by talking about for instance right they're told to get up and deal with it and so on and so forth i would just like to say and point out that you can't get give the given give credit for this argument opening government why because this is literally not forgiveness culture this is the culture of like i don't know like patriarchal misogynistic toughen up culture right this is not the same as saying hey let's forgive that person and then move on as opposed to when people say toughen up you have to take it this is how the system works that's not a forgiveness culture that they are talking about right so they've conflated another toxic culture and call that forgiveness culture we don't think that that's necessarily happening so we don't think minorities are being surprised are being told in fact not to speak up and we don't and we think even if they were it is in no way powerful enough to actually stop them from speaking up in fact what effectively happens and i think the more important debate which they missed out on i will take cg in a while more important thing they missed out on is how do minorities when they do speak up because they overwhelmingly do how do they affect the change first as we already explained that the oppressor is less likely to cram down on them which is something they have not actually meaningfully responded to they just said no that's never a situation that occurs but number two is also about how you approach that right so if an oppressor is told that you are not personally accountable but there are some things for redress to happen that effectively means they're more likely to listen because on them that that means they can focus on the concerns at hand they can focus on the current inequality without saying you are racist you are this you can never be forgotten forgiven because that means they don't feel personally attacked and we think that leads to a situation where they're more likely to accommodate the con what they call it the concerns of the oppressed people in the first place in a way that they never do in opening government i will now take closing so to be clear minorities are blamed for constructed crimes that they didn't commit but this norm of forgiveness is not constructed by the same majority so for some reason the majority will sing kumbaya and love all of these minorities that is your case okay i'm a bit confused about what you said like look narratives are not consciously formed by a group of elite conspirators people pushing down on the minorities it is formed in a lot of ways that people don't even realize it's seen in movies etc etc so it's not like you know it's formed in a way that's like only exclusively pushed down on minorities it's in a way that the general society looks and perceives and interprets that right like i don't know zen culture or whatever people are into at that moment and we think it has an effect on both sides of the community and we have explained how both of those communities respond in different ways and we've explained why this eventually helps minorities second what is the norm and i think this is where uh the second thing of opening government comes in where they try to say that the norm is overwhelmingly that you must always forgive and that's all and all and so on right look there's an overwhelming belief in society that materialism causes unhappiness yes society is extraordinarily materialistic why do i point this analogy it is because just because there is a belief doesn't mean that necessarily that is the overwhelming narrative that everyone is being pressured to follow at any point in time i.e this forgiveness is a virtual narrative is literally a necessary counter force to the norms that exist in society that tell people not to forgive in the first place i think sajid already talked to you about how hate forgiveness and hatred of people for what they have done to you evolutionary wise has created communities because that that hatred of the other because of what they've done to you and not forgiving them means people are able to form communities so there's an evolutionary instinct to it but also in modern society it is constructed right movies tell you about black and white there is no gray area in terms of morality so it's always someone else has wronged you and it is okay to hate on them because the other person is always the bad guy right so it is in that sense that it is constructed into you to hate what does this mean right so forgiveness by the way is therefore tied to hate and you can't believe what dpm said about how it is not this also means when for example you don't forgive other people you don't forgive immigrants for taking your jobs this is when the politics is allowed to make you hate it is when developing countries are able to say hey go ahead and you know vote for me because i took away that person who harmed you for example revolutionaries right this is when people are able to say be tough on crime because those black people who committed crimes deserve no sympathy and we must take revenge on them these are massive harms that happen the opening government never dealt with we're proud to oppose thank you um can i just get 30 seconds i will just plug in my laptop one second thank you um you now welcome the number of covenants am i audible so what is the top room at the allegedly most competitive competition this year r.i.p doxbridge world this was a very underwhelming opening half two things in this speech one framing two extension framing three points the first point is to just observe the where deadlock we have at opening half about how forgiveness will apply between merger origins and minorities opening government sort of says ah these minorities they get screwed over by the majority this looks like apartheid and then you have meant to forgive them equally asserts nah these majorities construct what is wrong consuming drugs is wrong and only because we have a normal forgiveness will we treat these african americans with some sense of more forgiving attitude than an account of our like in a counterfactual why this wasn't enough i think both of this is both assertive and lacking in any clear application of how virtues shape psychologies or practical reasoning i don't know how you want to divide it i suspect both of them are just assertive at best second point of framing opening government i think over tries over like tries to blow up how much impact this debate will have they tell us our current trend of over forgiving we agree with this as a problem we're just not sure that they solve it either why is that because even though things aren't virtues you could still have reasons for overgiving this could mean that the social awkwardness and the forgiveness when someone bumps into you on the train means you automatically say sorry to them this is the kind of over forgiveness or the harms of over forgiveness which will probably still exist whether or not forgiveness is a virtue and opening government never tells us why both harms are the harms we should be caring about rather than the ones that come specifically from constructions of virtue the last thing is i think it's really ironic from leader of opposition to try to close the debate tactically and say we will have no macro harm and then have an entire opening opposition case that is apparently changing criminal laws maybe in some countries or rather if it's a regress motion it should have been about how we wouldn't have these really shitty messed up laws because we were forgiving people it was not clear what they were gaining from these norms of forgiveness in any useful set i think with those three pieces of framing out of the way i want to have very clear lines of analysis the first one is a slightly messy but i think really fair extension analysis extension from opening government which is i think opening government tries to go for these like really really lovely minorities get better impact without rising spending enough time explaining to the panel what it means to be a virtue rather than in john's speech i want to quote him it means there's a positive obligation and you will say and you will forgive earlier than you should have that is i say i promise the extent of which they have told us what a construction of a virtue does and how it impacts individual psychology and practical reasoning extension within this now why is this extension the most important thing over opening government because if we prove this we actually show you why rather than some word nebulous over forgiveness being the problem creation of a virtue has this issue first what is a virtue you might ask a virtue is a preeminent reason to action it means that you would choose to do something all else being equal because it is a virtue so if you think following the law is a virtuous thing all else being equal you would follow the law if you think saying good morning to your parents when you wake up as a virtue then even if you're having a slightly foul day unless your parents have literally like tried to assault you you would still say good warning to them every morning it's a pre reason to act that means you don't apply or specifically analyze how you should be acting in that in which instance so for example if honesty wasn't a virtue at every instance we would reevaluate whether we should be honest whether we should stay silent and be ambiguous or whether we should lie that is why we're happy for having honest days of virtue because we think people should always preeminently be telling the truth all else being equal what is forgiveness and being a virtue mean it means you preclude options beyond just the antonym of forgiveness which oh says is violence or anger but it means you preclude terminating relationships includes not doing anything for now and letting it fester as it is precludes taking some time to reflect on how you feel and then acting on it oh gee to keep giving them credit takes out a little bit of this they say yeah you might still get too early and you shouldn't have i don't think they explain why it is the nature of a virtue to have this effect on your people it's not just because of like moral philosophy says this or practical reasoning term it's also just how a psychology is built it means that when you tell someone like you're made like hey my girlfriend is like sort of trying to cheat on me or pressurizing me to have an open relationship you may say man i think you should forgive her like this is okay or if you're having a hard conv or if you suppose your mate doesn't ever text you like some friends of mine never reply to my messages it means i should forgive them as a preeminent way of acting rather than confront them or have hard conversations about it or reach out to my other friends it means that and this is what's important about forgiveness and og identifies this we'll give them the kids they say ah you need to forgive when someone has done something wrong to you correct but you don't tell us then what that means for your psyche at that time it means you're in a moment of trauma confusion ambiguity of what is the next step for you to be taking and that is why when you have not only a like moral practical reasoning point but also a psychic enforcement by a majority narrative that is what pushes you to then overwhelmingly forgive when you shouldn't have on our world we would still have forgiveness we might still have over forgiveness we're fine with that what we robber want is for individuals to make reasoned decisions to not let forgiveness see what guides their actions when they think all else is equal but to reflect on how they should be working this means lovers having harder conversations with each other this means friends being harder and tougher on each other and what it means to be a good friend rather than just constantly internalizing this i think this takes us to a second extension which is impact of this opening government didn't say what are these impacts well i think i've already alluded to some of them it means that rather than having constant cycles of forgiveness of the forgiveness of forgiveness which should happen anyway it's having those harder conversations or having more meaningful resolutions even if it's longer or in some cases escalation and splitting up and fighting and that's okay we don't care it means you have more thoughts and you're able to autonomize your decision in a way that you wouldn't if this is a virtue before i move on to the second impact of this opening opposition all of these asserted benefits in your world still rely on disproving the network socially constructed counter forces that we explained you exist to overwhelmingly not forgive yeah no i think this is a i think opening government already called you out on it but i will do it in a better way than they did why does opening oppositions like humans are nasty british and live short life not true one humans are emotions and they're over exaggerated that is symmetrical you might over exaggerate how much not forgiving someone will affect you and you will forgive them two they have good memories no memories suck famously that is why they wouldn't remember this in such a useful way three they tell us hate is let me say ah people hate naturally hate is super hard in interpersonal relationships because even though they've done shitty things to you they've also done good things to you that makes it so conflicting on how to resolve it if you had only framed it if you yourselves are famous in interpersonal relationships this societal hate stuff falls out so why that means all your biological essentialism was the counterfactual for norm being violence just doesn't stand what last impact is this the last impact that we don't think opening government gives us is that this normalizes exploitative behavior individuals in a world in which they know there's a norm of forgiveness are more willing to act in ways that they don't impact on others because they know that even without the effort of apologizing or reconciling they would be more likely to expect a forgiveness from the other individual whether that's a minority majority doesn't matter what is important to notice that is that it normalizes behaviors everything on fact virtues have a effect on our psychology not practical reasoning we showed you how that happens that is the most important impact and analysis how to propose thank you we now welcome member of opposition almost all of that is either derivative or irrelevant because it is essentially the same claim made at opening government opening governments say something is a virtue so you do it very often it constructs a heuristic and the only additional step from cg is to say yeah it's a preeminent reason right that is opening government's case you had a few benefits you're probably not going to win we're going to do something different we're going to give you three extensions each of which indicate win the debate the first thing i'm going to prove is healing opening opposition flag this when they say you can move on i'm going to give you four structural reasons why healing gets better when you have more forgiveness and specifically forgiveness as a virtue the first is that that you yourself get the proactive decision exercise power in a personal capacity you after stripped you of autonomy are able to exercise that choice which is freeing and empowering second it is a personal signaling mechanism trauma is often something that you're ready to move on from and thus you are easy more easily able to access things like counseling when you emotionally say to yourself that you're moving on from this specific thing and you say that to yourself that that is part of your past third it positions yourself as the higher moral being relative to your oppressor you say to yourself i am better than that person i am better than that i am moving on from this and fourth it is an active choice to seek goodness in the world to see reform in the world which moves on from that instance so this wins us the opening half clash because opening government says well perhaps sometimes you you like move on too early our claim and our substantive reasons suggest that even if you move on a bit preemptively that is often better for yourself than the counterfactual the second thing i want to establish under this extent engine the party involved which is new two reasons why first being forgiven is often a shock counter-intuitive you did something terrible to someone it often doesn't make logical sense why they would choose to move on from that and when you yourself acknowledge that you've made a mistake but that you can move past it then it also sends the message to the other person that they can move on from that trauma as well second it removes the torment and anguish which often fuels that behavior and continues to fuel other counterproductive behaviors and this is not just a debate about terrible assaults this is also debates about simple acts of guilt like drunk driving which can often lead to enormous guilt and feed into things like mental illness and substance abuse ours is the side that allows you to move on from those specific things three impacts then first we make these offenders better people and the counter factual is often there would be no forgiveness more animosity towards them which fuels those bad behaviors and those bad views second it humanizes the victim on the other side which means you are more likely to view them as a legitimate actor and third as i said often it is able to move you on from those the immense guilt and the uh damaging behaviors that resulted thereof that is our first extension it i think quite neatly wins the open clash and hopefully you can see why second claim how does this affect social movements and specifically engaging with opening government's material about the vulnerable four new things here the first thing is to establish that forgiveness being positioned as a virtue puts more pressure on the virtuous people to act appropriately so closing government in a py is correct something being virtuous often is constructed for instance by judeo-christian norms but notably the people who historically were constructed as virtuous were necessarily the privileged white men which meant that there was additional pressure on them to subsume the virtue rather than the opposite way round that meant that it was overwhelmingly a upward pressure towards privileged people as opposed to the opposite the second thing to establish is that when they do forgive minorities now subsume that virtuous space which leads to a more positive perception of that group that empowers civil rights movements when they're able to say in your anglicized christian like modern america we are the team that or we are the your virtuous space which leads to more positive perceptions of them which generates them the capital to make better decisions moving forward the third thing to say is that additionally from that it also contrasts you favorably against the offending party so when actually actively attacks you and you choose to forgive them you look better by contrast to them and it highlights their lack of virtue comparatively fourth when forgiveness is not given it is now a far far more powerful condemnation and this is something opening opposition entirely misses and engages with closing government's case because now when you say that that particular transgression is so incredibly bad that i just cannot forgive despite the back and it is virtuous to do so it actively positions those greatest harms as being particularly salient and it draws particular attention to those people so when you say i'm sorry as selma hayek i just cannot forgive harvey weinstein that positions far far more aggression rage and condemnation towards him and that is incredibly important because the counterfactual is that with a lot more absence of forgiveness a lot more rage than the market and the sense of that occurring is far far far wider so there are four unique reasons why social movements become better and the vulnerable are assisted on our side the third thing i'm going to bring you is with respect to conflict and states and how it improves them but before i do so i'll take opening government if you have something so brock turner was given a low sentence for a rape because he was told that he had a promising life ahead of him it doesn't matter if in theory it is possible for like forgiveness to be used productively if the nature of society is to always disproportionately leverage it in bad circumstances to the benefit of people who are already privileged okay so i think the difficulty with this is it sort of runs entirely into the argument that i've already made my claim is not that people like brock turner don't exist my claim is not that there are exceptions where that norm is applied poorly but i've just given you substantive reasons why there are all the inverse forms of that argument right for every single instance in the 1950s and 60s where african americans could subsume the biblical trope of turning the other cheek that made them look better which got them social reform that is more important than brock turner finally let's talk about states the first thing to establish here is that opening opposition tries to frame out the macro there are four reasons why they can't the first is we've provided additional micro analysis the second is that this unlocks their material if you do believe that it's contingent on their material for larger impacts the third is that forgiveness operates differently on a larger scale and the fourth is that they discuss this anyway so then why is it that forgiveness is a benefit to states which are either in conflict or post-conflict the first thing to establish here is that it allows you to accept the center on the other side can change and it is malleable in their personality and in their agency the second reason is it stops the cyclicism of conflict because when one person wrongs you you now wrong them back and that is you need a circuit breaker for that particular interaction unless you continuously move within that particular like form of transaction and notably without that this team would just have ongoing conflict in areas where people just despise one another third the act of forgiveness positions the first mover as virtuous and it places pressure on the other party to accept so when siddharth approaches metacam for the clamp david accords there is pressure on manukam to accept it because of that first mover advantage which leads to that circuit breaker fourth there is often deep-seated and long-term anger on a nationwide scale which is rooted in the immense trauma of your ancestors being slaughtered it's anger fanned by jingo and propaganda that means that this isn't just a debate about individual instances of forgiveness this is a debate about wars ending this is a debate about human rights being finally recognized and if you think that is the most important thing in this debate as you should closing opposition thank you we now welcome the government with loadable i'm very glad closing opposition has found the remedy to the afghanistan con the apartheid regime and all lies who knew in a virtue of forgiveness you know the one that is the cause of all of these conflicts the one that despite this being a regrets motion has allowed us to heal virtues do not overhaul society they do not revamp perverse incentives they don't massively involve people's responses a virtue is something that allows people to make changes in marginal senses and that's what we bring you a lot of other factors act upon all of the things mentioned on the opposition bench how you act is something that is shaped by your upbringing how for example a minority community acts in a conflict is based on their impoverishment other considerations how a majority chooses to label a minority is based on their desire to maintain political power so they have to show sufficiency is overhauling this particular virtue sufficient enough such that they change that at best you can note the entire opposition's benches contribution as marginally increased capacity of minority communities to act or marginally increasing their capacity to move on but even still they don't tell you that's a good thing we tell you that this debate acts on the margins in times of trauma it is the response that you defer to as an individual when you don't know how else to make those decisions you're told that this is a virtuous act one that you should engage in when you don't have the capacity to make that calculation rather than waiting out that trauma and making the correct decision it means that people exploit you when they know the penalty for that or the risk that you're going to respond in a way that is that is not forgiving is far lower it precludes conversations in the interim it means when natural feelings do boil over after you've forgiven someone you're seen as bitter someone who hasn't gotten over it even though you emotionally forgave someone and that means that this is a debate that acts on the margins and the thing that you can credit us for is that literal contributions are linked inextricably to the virtue of forgiveness itself you can't attribute it to other norms like hatred like political power like majorities having control over narratives you can link it specifically to people's instinctive responses that's why we win on a consideration of weight itself i'm gonna do two things and i don't appreciate the chat in the chat uh the con i'm gonna say silly that commentary is firstly i'm gonna look at ceo and their assertion avenue secondly i'm gonna look at ooh and their stunning symmetry firstly they tell us well when you don't forgive it becomes a really big deal uh yeah i agree the application of this is terrible it is labeled against kashmir when they act in retaliation and their acts are labeled as unforgivable acts the people who by the concession of opening opposition have the most capacity to be able to reform people's behaviors or to know or to title something as unforgivable are those majority communities and thankfully ceo gives us this analysis and it's why opening opposition's material does not stand because sentences in which this virtue you don't have doesn't act and those belong to the people of the classy to shape it but secondly even when you don't forgive we think it doesn't become a big deal you become shamed for it especially when people have less fear of stigma or condemnation when you have a low amount of power in that discourse and people don't mind shaming you because there's not going to be any repercussions for them they call you bitter they call you vindictive they call you crazy in a way that you don't have the capacity to the next thing that they say is well people are the people who receive forgiveness are act likely to act in a better way no because when they perceive it to be a virtue and they think that is an obligation that is owed to them they're far more likely to act in the exploitative ways that katie tells you about they're far more likely on the margins to exploit you in a way that's terrible it's not responsive at all from the closing opposition case when they know that the deference to forgiveness exists it's far likely to be worse the next thing that they say is there's increased obligations on people to uh on virtuous people to appear virtuous uh the classic epl extension from closing opposition from opening opposition moves already says this but clearly that is not the case in terms of who these people are because our capacity to interpret what is virtuous is instantiated by the examples the media the figures the catholic church curtains provide and to that extent it might not be conspiratorial as moob says but it is certainly a way that our intuitions are constructed which means these people don't have an additional obligation tag virtuous they just set up the metrics by which virtue exists in the first place and excuse and excuse away their behavior in a way that most people don't have the capacity to hold account the last thing that they say is something on minorities become moral arbiters and that is a good thing because people respect them i think firstly i'm going to reject this premise because it requires people relinquishing their moral value as a hegemonic power in a lot of instances but secondly no they shouldn't become moral laborers they should fight for their rights and they shouldn't forgive in a lot of instances that's what we tell you cgo is comprehensively out of this debate let's look at stunning symmetry and astonishing overreach the best claim they say is that there is a proclivity not to forgive and this is a correction mechanism and they give some stupid assertive reasons like there's a cardinal instinct not to give and there are bad memories there's also things like a fear of confrontation a desire to overcome trauma to get closure to reach for forgiveness because you've done it before and it feels good all of these things are more likely for the reason that individuals even if they have that carnal instinct would like to avoid things like confrontation would have a survival instinct they'd like to avoid conflict to begin with so the balance of probabilities you can't buy all of the assertions but secondly it's very unclear that these are corrective and i'll take over in a second oh do you point out that this acts on different people differently which means it's unclear that this is a corrective measure on people who are the most privileged to no response from opening opposition what you're yet to respond to is the fact that we've already explained even for utilitarian purposes the moment you don't forgive you're more emotional that can harm social movements for lots of structural reasons that we've given yeah yeah okay so so the tension in their case is the macro microsoft so you you you get political capital and you're more likely to succumb to rage that rage occurs anyway in the long run when you forgive too early and therefore when you realize you've forgiven too early and you become angry you are seen as as as disrupting the peace you're seen as someone that is um making sure that past wrongs come back up as the person that's responsible to relationships and social movements now being disrupted it is better that people get earlier angry after the wrongdoing happens and their response is immediate rather than the weaponization of that response by hegemonic actors buy into people in interpersonal relationships in ways that are terrible but where it does act on those minorities is terrible they they are painted as savages they are painted as people that don't have respect for civil obedience when they didn't agitate for their rights to begin with clearly the majority of material in this debate is symmetric at best there are very small changes as a result of a bunch of other norms causing most of the impacts in this debate you have to isolate the impact this has on interpersonal relationships and your responses we do that in closing government very proud to stand in golf thank you we now welcome um i'm gonna get pretty real in high school i was bullied pretty severely and a few years ago i reached out to those bullies and i said i explained to them what they did to me and i actually told them that i forgive them that wasn't me not standing up for myself that was me reasserting my power in that situation and that provided me an extreme sense of catharsis and that was actually having the very conversations that cg want us to have in this debate that is what sheamus explains to you in extension gets zero response from us and that is why we overwhelmingly win this debate a few things i'm going to look at conflicts i'm going to look at micro interactions some framing and then if i get time the front half of this debate which i think is far less relevant firstly in terms of conflicts sajid makes a weird claim which is that the macro isn't important but then here's a confusing reason as to why so you should have just tried to have a crack at this material honestly sheamus provides quite a lot of explanation as to why we get better post-conflict outcomes when this is a virtue for a myriad of reasons including the fact that it signals that change is possible uh that the other side can change that the fact that there's a first mover advantage and so on and so on and arth only mocks this at whip by saying oh we don't solve you know the middle east yes arth you are correct however this obviously applies at certain margins like it can obviously act as a bit of a tipping point in terms of situations where there might be existing tensions or it could just add to and solidify existing narratives around why they ought to be post-conflict resolution right and we think this indeed has been successful in the past such as in situations like rwanda but furthermore the continuation issue and why we all not regret it means that it is likely to apply into the future and that is obviously a massive massive benefit in this debate certainly something that means that those societies are able to heal and move on from extreme acts of violence uh in a number of situations so that is a very unique benefit that we win and i think is still largely standing despite the mocking from our closing government so with that in mind i'm going to move to the next claim in this debate which is the micro level benefits because we gave a lot of reasons at sheamus about why this is good for you personally this obviously directly clashes with opening government's material and again no just by saying you can move on we mechanized explicitly why this is the case sheamus explains that this gives you personal power because you're saying that i'm the actor in this situation it signals to yourself that you're ready to move on and put it fast you the fact that you feel morally good about yourself and it encourages you to have a positive out in the world we have silence in response from closing government that is insufficient because this again goes to the very metric of the debate which both opening both government teams seem to care about which is what is good for people who have been transgressed the other thing importantly is that we tell you why it needs to be a virtue even though those are it's often not intuitive to people therefore it needs to be a virtue in order for you to then do that act and co-opt those benefits right um but you know what i'll give uh og a chance to respond to that if they'd like yeah sure so this one line and whip that it's not intuitive to you why forgiving your bullies in high school would be good it's the only reason you've given why people wouldn't have other non-like reasons based on the societal virtue to forgive surely people will forgive anyway when it's in their interest our entire cases there are many pressures to forgive when it is not in your interest and that's the problem i'm going to get to that stuff later but in terms of why i literally just explained that matt the reason you don't necessarily think these benefits apply to you is that it is counterintuitive right like you don't it's really weird to think that forgiving someone you do might make you feel better that's why it needs to be a virtue then you access those benefits even though you don't think you will super obvious guys okay responding to cg because honestly i'm a bit unclear what their extension is they spend two minutes wasting a definitional explanation of what virtue is and then they say that this encourages you to have some difficult conversations and then they talk a bit about minorities the first observation i have is that the minority stuff is extremely derivative of their opening in terms of difficult conversations as i've already explained we think forgiveness goes hand in hand with those conversations that cg wants because you say this is what has happened i'm unhappy with you however i forgive you and in fact i think it is easier to have those conversations with people at the point where you're putting yourself out there and saying yes it's difficult but i forgive you and even if it is a little bit earlier than a person might otherwise like think is good it is unclear why that is always a bad thing if it unlocks the benefits that we uh provide in this debate so that's why i think cg is clearly out let's look at though how this affects the other person again because this clash is directly with a lot of the claims that both governments make about this lets you get away with your behavior uh sheamus explains to you also in extension that this is likely to change behavior from like parties that have oppressed or trans grieves the first is because they're probably going to be less defensive when you approach them because you're kind of giving them i guess something that is good so therefore they're more likely to introspect rather than be defensive about that situation secondly sheamus tells you that they'll want to earn that forgiveness to some extent and thirdly that instances where forgiveness is not given attract additional public scrutiny because it's seen as quite a big deal right and the only response art gives at whip is just to say that ah but because this is such a norm it means there's just like no like reason for you to you know then then be introspective like yes it is a norm and yes people do it more but i don't think that changes the shock value of oh like i've done something wrong and someone's telling me i've done something wrong but they're being really nice about it and forgiving me so i don't think that dynamic changes oh gee then just say that's so like you're a sexual offender and you say like i'm great because that person has forgiven me i just don't think that's how the norm plays out i think there's still a recognition uh about you know the fact that that person has done a bad thing so some framing why do we be opening opposition i think we actually mechanize why this is good for you and uh why this requires action uh from other parties secondly our arguments aren't predicated on rage being the counterfactual and third we add a significant micro uh macro argument which adds a massive benefit to this debate we also beat both government teams i think because we respond to their claims and actually win the very stakeholders that they care about which is both yourself which could include minorities and also other parties but i'll also quickly uh add now that i've got some time the thing about uh minorities but this is i think there's a recognition that forgive forgiveness might be somewhat more difficult for minority groups that have been oppressed in some instances so i don't think this is as exploitive as they say secondly as sheamus also provides you an extension because often norms around forgiveness are constructed by majorities they often are expected to live up to those expectations more ensuite overwhelmingly with this debate thank you um please go away for now and we will call you back in when we are ready to chat
