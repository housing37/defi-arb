 two one we cannot do anything for the individuals that have previously been killed by things like the crusade we cannot do anything for the individuals that have been previously killed over things like arbitrarily constructed racial genocides what we can do is do things for the individuals in the future that would be killed by things like this and many many more opening government is going to make three arguments the first argument we're going to make is to explain why humanity's existence is a net negative for humanity the second thing that we are arguing that we are going to make is to explain why even if you don't believe that humanity's existence for all other forms of life is a net negative that necessarily outweighs any clash on humanity itself and i encourage you not to be what the majority of people are in the world panel do not be self-centered think about things like animals think about things like the environment think about for example the way we torture animals for our own over consumption of me the final thing i will then do is explain why humanity is likely to end anyway and this is the best possible way to end it so on humanity's existence being a net negative uh for itself there are uh what is it four parts for this argument the first part of the argument is to explain that evolutionarily most people are programmed when they live a net negative utility life not to for example do things like be suicidal uh which obviously means that people who do live net negative lives are often biologically forced to endure that but the second thing that i'll know as part of this first uh mechanism is that every single person is programmed not to be content evolutionarily and that is for the reason that often when you're content you don't have the evolutionary drive to exist within competition and to push yourself that means they limit and capacity for which humans are able to be happy is evolutionarily capped out because we're constantly comparing ourselves to our environment and other individuals in a way that prevents us from fully ever being happy the second thing that i'll explain is that capitalism often exploits individuals firstly in the way that is very obvious in terms of for example you have to sell your labor in a way that creates unequal power dynamics but also it is terrible for atomizing individuals in a way that for example makes people far more predisposed to things like mental health in a way that makes them see the world through the eyes of consumerism thirdly we're going to say that climate change is often irreversible a tipping point has been reached which means even if any opposition team can prove that we might totally switch to forms of our you know existence that is complete renewable they don't disprove this harm but no i think it would be very unlikely that they could prove that for the reason that people are short uh short-termist and there are already huge amounts of corporate capture that exists and because climate change is irreversible that means that there are things like a scarcity of resources which means that people necessarily will starve but also it means that there are likely to be wars over those resources it means that entire countries are likely to be submerged in water and it's likely that the scarcity of resources compounds as a problem into the future because of things like population growth the final part of this argument is just to explain that more specifically capitalism is built off oppressing people that's because of things like the global value chain and the exploitation of labor that exists overseas and what i would say is that necessarily means that there is always an underclass that disproportionately suffers relative to the rest of the world and when i conclude this argument i would like to know that the extent and the way that suffering is distributed is fundamentally principally just you do not choose where or when you are born you do not for example choose to be screwed over by the lottery of birth and the majority of individuals if not all individuals are screwed over by this uh the next argument i'll then make is to explain why humanity's existence destroys all other forms of life the first part of this argument is to explain that capitalism often relies on destroying huge amount of land and ego systems for things like production but things like the creation of new factories or for things like uh you know the creation of fuel in a lot of instances that wins it means that we necessarily do things like pollution but secondarily it also necessarily means that uh pardon me that like the way that we do things like provide for ourselves in terms of meeting uh like farming animals and things is a way that is created to be optimized and that is why you necessarily have things like animals not being killed humanely and not being killed proportional to what we need to survive but simply being farmed day in and day out mother cows are forced to birth children and then watch them be slaughtered so hormonally they produce more milk we say this way of treating other animals and ecosystems is abhorrent and compounds any amount of suffering that humanity could ever experience secondly though i'll reiterate what i say about climate change to the extent that these are effects are irreversible uh or often are you know are about to reach a tipping point and that means that obviously all of these other ecosystems are over by this and i'll explain obviously why later killing humanity means that you know you don't often have those ecosystems destroyed the third thing before i do that though i'll explain is that this is we're unlikely to ever create a relationship with other animals that gives them an equal amount of say or privilege for the reason that we care about ourselves more both evolutionarily and it is a norm within society that obviously just means that there are a huge subset of animals that continue to experience disproportionate amounts of suffering compared to the rest of humanity and obviously if you kill off humanity in this instance and i'm about to explain why this is the best way to do it the extent to which things like climate change wipes out species upon species is obviously slow and in many instances prevented before i go on i'll take closing opposition what is the underlying moral justification that your case depends upon to work for why things like human oppression are bad you need to engage in the moral clash uh i think it's pretty morally bad to have on a utility level the amount of people continuing to suffer more i second of all explain why they suffer arbitrarily thirdly also i explain why uh you shouldn't care about animals in terms of suffering less than humans so if we explain for example why there is net suffering the world from the creation of humanity's existence you ought morally oppose that existence so why is humanity likely to end anyway and why is this the best way to end them third argument in this speech first of all we think humanity is likely to end anyway for things like the amount of diseases that exist in the world and are currently multiplying not only things like covert 19 exists but see the way that the us has currently lobbied the world like health organization to remove the patents that african pharmaceutical industries have to combat things like local diseases we think this means that a huge amount of people if not all humanity are likely to inevitably die secondly i explain why structurally there's likely to be a huge amount of wars and exploitation and no humanity has reached the point where we have the capacity to wipe each other out with things like nukes or the pressure of a button but thirdly see things like the fermi paradox which suggests that the reason why we haven't encountered an alien civilization is because there is a barrier to most advanced civilizations being reached one that humanity seems that it will face in the next hundred to two hundred years so why is this the best way to do it three simple reasons one this is obviously painless that means that the amount of suffering that occurs is condensed to one specific moment and is not obviously as bad as for example being tortured but second of all we don't take the rest of the planet with us and that means that we win on the moral clash that is engaged in with that poi i encourage you to use your imagination i encourage you to care about the world i'm going to say that fine speech i'm super happy to welcome the leader of your position hello can i be heard you can't be hurt okay let me just turn on my camera great i assume i can be seen because i can see myself um the speech content warning will contain mentions of suicide torture etc all sorts of atrocious stuff i feel it's important to clear that out before i start my speech okay by the way is there um like any background noise in my end uh can people hear something are we good um is it like i guess so um but it's not distracting oh okay uh it's like it's like it sounds like something like that yeah i figure the i figure the embarrassment of like scrambling for my like aircon life remote this less worth it than just like the minor inconvenience of there being like a shh i guess okay starting my speech in three i'll take you guys in chat starting my speech in three two and one you come across a button with the potential to instantly shoot a bullet into the forehead of everyone sleeping you have attachments to these people you believe in these people you know they have hopes and dreams this is murder and goes against every moral intuition you have in this speech we will advance four claims one that this is murder and goes against again every moral intuition you have two that you have attachments to your own life and moreover not pressing the button will drastically improve your quality of life moving forward three humanity is likely to get structurally better and happier as time goes on and for the animal rights case that leaving humanity to die will effectively push climate change and a variety of other anthropogenic problems forward without any solution because animals do not have the tools to save themselves first and by the way responses are integrated into the material first this is murder to you which will go against every moral intuition you have this is analogous to walking into the room of every person's house while they are sleeping and shooting to them we have very very strong aversions to killing people and the loss of life the loss of experience and the basic destruction of everything people have ever had for five structural reasons number one is revulsion we feel a strong sense of empathy that is part biological and part evolutionary where depriving people of their choice and happiness is anathema to us because we internally value our own happiness and because we empathize with other people that they may value their own happiness and choice as well this is why we don't kill slaves even if their life might suck this is why we experience extreme revulsion if we shoot somebody that might be sleeping or going through extreme pain because we should give them the decision to make that themselves and not assume it for them secondarily socialization this person has been historically taught about the wonders of humanity human achievement genius overcoming the limitations of the human body feeling like you are preventing the future progress basically society socializes most people into believing humanity is an inherent good and this is feel good so it catches on quick hence this narrative is structured like to be deeply embedded in your worldview you are going against every social factor that has influenced you in your life thirdly they have personal connections to many of the people they are disappearing whom they care about you want to see them flourish you want to see them happy you want to see them reach their full potential imagine you had a mom who will never get to see you grow old you have a kid who will never get to finish college a wife or a husband you will never get to grow old with you have relationships with these people you care about them and you are taking their lives away fourthly obligations you feel extreme and obliterating guilt like you are betraying everyone that trusted you everyone that raised you and fifthly after life the fear of going to hell that you were the one that murdered all these people you will have to face penance for your actions you will have to greet them and they will have you will have to answer for the reckoning of why you took away their lives why are these structural reasons the most important to you number one this is not just a motion about whether or not it's not morally good but from the perspective of the infoslide you an average person are coming across a button and you are making the choice to end the world hence there are four weighing method reasons for why you should care about this more than their meta reasons number one this is the prevailing mindset as this is related to the relevant factors in your thought process these structural reasons are themselves the meta weighing for why certain reasons are more important because even if theoretically you can consider other reasons like the future end of humanity these are the top of mind fears for a decision as momentous as this secondarily though principally they assert that there is some negative utility but the problem is that they are asserting this utility for people when everyone has their own utility calculus that you and only you can know this means it makes no sense to kill everyone for the sake of some arbitrary utility since we assign the utility value and it may like you remove obviously the person's capacity to assign that real utility value for themselves you are effectively turning everyone into slaves and deciding for them that their life is not worth living as opposed to letting them decide thirdly this is most proximate to you the people you grew up with your likely outlook on life these are all the predominant prime factors in your decision-making calculus hence is more closely related to what you care about than humanity's net utility or whatever and fourth thing finally the sheer guilt and uncertainty in your head the pain aversion that most people have to potentially taking everything away this is akin to being on the ledge of a cliff on the ledge of a roof and threatening to jump off but taking everyone else with you this is just not something that most people will do people do not have the moral resiliency or will to do this this is just evil i'll take a py from cg before i move on uh these names are all based off of moral intuitions can you justify why moral intuition approximates moral truth no no no no these are moral intuitions the average person will have you are making the decision from the perspective of an infoslide you're the third party here hence you're making it from your lens so these moral intuitions are truths to you secondarily though you also want to give your own life again by construction if you wanted to end your own life you don't really need the button most people have strong intuitionist attachments to their pleasures and their hobbies moreover when you do prevent from don't use the button you feel like you saved the world you feel like you prevented mass scale genocide of you the human race you can always carry yourself with the feeling of self-importance that you were at one point the most important person in the world and you're likely to experience a strong sense of satisfaction and relief appreciation for your life even for the parts that aren't so good akin to the relief that people feel after a last second of version of a suicide attempt or a near-death experience it puts your life into sharp clarity and every good thing that happens he was magnified intensely every bad thing that happened to you could always be rationalized away as something worse could have happened okay secondary uh third sorry third point we also think humanity is likely to get structurally better and happier as time goes on they sort of assert that humanity is not negative that people are programmed to be never content capitalism is exploitative and atomizes people and climate change is reversible and we have scarce resources we have faced all these problems before global conditions are rapidly and persistently improving for four structural reasons one we are reaching a point of scientific innovation that has erased the burdens of most human struggles we're allowing people to communicate across borders solving most diseases we could never have conceived of before two increasing democratization and global trade as well as increasing education in most countries around the world gives nations mutual incentives to prosper and develop on a widespread scale this is why capitalism is getting less and less exploitative why there are increasing factors about every nation in the world on the repacious nation of capitalism and corporations thirdly more and more educated societies are willing to criticize governments provide crucial services necessary for the maintenance of life etc reducing the optimization and forming communities for people as well as they are learning to communicate to people across the world you know informed communities there and we assume that we would run out of natural resources several centuries ago we were wrong every time because our technological pasty allows us to make the most of limited resources and do things like find new lands or find new resources we can use go to different planets this is all potential that you erase away with the assumption that you know better than every other person on earth beyond that they say humanity will die anyway one this is super speculative and i'm not sure how this will play out in the calculus of a person or the average person will be pressing this button but secondarily there's just a lot of assumptions about oh we might have a nuclear war this is why persistently humanity is working towards defraying many of these worst harms and ensuring that we can come to solutions for most of these things you basically take away the potential for humanity to come out for any of these solutions like a 10 chance that humanity might die in the future even if humanity will suffer we let them make the choice to suffer and die finally the animal rights case they say animals are farmed one this is way better than being hunted and brutally killed exposed to fuse food scarcity being forcefully raped and killed to be made in order for like the genetic thing to advance right these are all experiences animals will have that they don't have in farms so they are fed where they are kept safe et cetera and even in like you know most reasonable states around the world will have animal rights welfare regulations anyway but think of the dangers of all the stuff that's left behind nuclear reactors oil refineries etc many of these problems are increasingly accelerating and we're anthropogenic in nature climate change is already happening global warming is already happening animals don't have the tools to stop this they're going to go extinct anyway it's only our side that has tools to potentially versus in the future they have condemned the world to death already them like you know taking the easy way out taking the escape button is not going to solve things at the end of this speech it is clear this is murder horrible and basically revulsive to everything you've ever known this is taking away everything you've ever cared about in your own life and this is worse for humanity with large for these reasons opposed i am the leader of the opposition for that my speech i'm super happy to welcome the deputy prime minister hey sorry just give me like 30 seconds if that's all right i have a lot of paper sitting around here sorry sorry over here i'm presuming at this point i could be heard i presume some would have told me while i was taking time if i couldn't yeah you're horrible sorry about that there's a lot of paper all right i'm gonna start my speech in three two one first i'm gonna respond to opening opposition then i'm gonna weigh our material let's start with the claims from opening opposition i actually first i'm gonna start with the poi from closing opposition which is to say what is the moral framework well the question is in what way or we could construct a moral framework we don't think we ought to because like morality isn't intrinsically true it's constructed right and the question is what is the best way to construct that moral framework clearly the best way to construct a moral framework is to construct it in such a way that gets the most utility for society otherwise that is a bad moral framework insofar as morality is not intrinsically good it's purely instrumental we should construct it in the way that gets the most instrumental utility therefore it cannot be net it cannot be moral in the world where applying that morality gets massive utility negativity i would say if your moral if your moral system gets massive negative utility then your moral system is bad and i shouldn't care about it you can't say oh this isn't about morality if we show this is awful for everyone we clearly win now let's deal with opening with opening opposition they say this goes against a set of moral intuitions yeah congratulations this motion is a little bit counterintuitive but you can't just point to those intuitions in particular because the average reasonable person is willing to be convinced that sets of intuitions are wrong you can't just say ah this is like counterintuitive therefore no one would ever do it the next thing they say as well you're going to feel a set of revulsions so this will be a personal harm to you first you're not going to feel revulsion for very long you're about to be erased second this second you're not like you're even if you feel a short-term sense of propulsion that is much better than the active pain and suffering for the rest of your life that you can experience that then proves to you finally i would say given the way that we are destroying humanity the way that humanity is having enormous amount of suffering you have a moral responsibility to do this and therefore you should do it even if you feel that sense of revulsion the next thing they say is will you care about other people yes you do we explain that this is utility negative for other people so we win on that the next thing they say is well you wouldn't do this uh because you like essentially the claim is like oh there's a handful of things that would stop people from being able to do this therefore they wouldn't but that is not how this debate works this debate isn't a prediction about what an individual would do in this scenario it is having a debate about what they should do we are giving you the sets of arguments that explain why it is that they should do this a person isn't always going to default to their moral intuitions the next thing they say is oh you're going to go to hell obviously the average reasonable person doesn't believe in a literal interpretation of hell in that way the average reasonable person across the world is getting less religious even if they are religious they do not believe in that super literal interpretation of health the next thing they say is well why do you have a right to be able to do this because you should you should like allow other people to be able to make that set of decisions for themselves first to the extent that we show that you're causing massive external harms for instance to animals and other creatures that is acceptable you can take away someone's autonomy if them using their autonomy is also harming others has sets of external harms additionally in order for them to say oh it's bad that we take away people's autonomy they need to prove that people are meaningfully exercising autonomy on their side of the house right we would say that people are not meaningfully exercising autonomy right because people are artificially constrained by an evolutionary system that says to them well you that says to them you have to continue existing noting there's nothing like good about what evolution hard codes for evolution just hard codes for continued existence that doesn't necessarily mean it hard codes for good things i'll take opening opposition i mean i could ask the same thing right like what is good about positive sensation negative utility these are things that we choose to value and these are also similarly evolutionarily constrained there's no reason to fire like this or the other value well i think in so far as a person experiences utility in their average life they experience good things and bad things that is a thing that people should intrinsically care about right and also because all other sets of creatures experience that the idea that like i don't think you're going to be able to rebut like utility is not important like obviously like we we have to make in some degree decisions about what is and what is not good so in order for this autonomy point to stand they have to prove that people are meaningfully exercising autonomy under their side i explain that people are not but the reason that uh that evolution hard codes you with a desire to continue to exist even where that is utility negative right but not because that's like good for you but just because that's the thing that allowed the combination of your species so therefore the sets of species you had that genetic code were the ones who are likely to promulgate not because it is in any way morally good secondly i'd say why is autonomy good because autonomy is not a prima facie good for individuals autonomy is good at the point where you can meaningfully exercise your preferences and therefore get preference fulfillment we would say that in this instance you are not fulfilling your preferences because you are making sets of bad decisions about continuing to exist finally even if this was true individuals also cannot consent to the other way in which humanity would end which is things like sets of diseases and sets of war so under so the problem with this argument is they don't prove they're consenting at all under their side even if they are consenting at the moment they're not going to consent to much worthwhile things like disease and nuclear war that are going to kill them okay that's opening opposition's material let's say what ben tells you first we explain to you that life is that life is suffering for a handful of reasons things like the fact that evolution hardcodes you to suffer in order to make you do things things like the fact that as society develops we subjugate each other through processes of capitalism that we're increasingly destroying the planet what do they say their one claim is well life is getting better because we are getting better at doing stuff first this doesn't get around the fact that even when you achieve more stuff humanity is still hard-coded to feel like they are unhappy because it drives us to do more things secondly this development is disproportionately going to those at the top and in fact it's increasing our ability to subjugate each other it's increasing our ability to say you have to work for me because i have more tools to subjugate you into making my life better finally the problem is there is a set of finite resources and they say oh we're getting more efficient yeah but like not no year ever has humanity use less natural resources obviously even if we're getting more efficient we're still using more resources and we're beginning to run out of oil like we like 19 years a large part of the gulf is going to run out of oil that will be absolutely terrible where the size of this contribution first it deletes opposition ventures harm because they have to prove that humanity is good in order for it to be good secondly for humanity like a big stakeholder in this debate we really take them second claim why this is terrible for all other sets of creatures we explain that there's no reason to preference humans over other creatures right there is they experience joy and pain and emotion and it's just the happenstance of the fact that we're the most powerful species that we constructed in that way what do they say they say animals are going to die more because they can't deal with climate change first obviously we stop the bad impacts of climate change happening because it's caused by the humans and secondly many of the impacts on animals are not actually climate change they're things like factory farming they're things like the fact that we take all of their resources they say no farming is better for animals first this is unresponsive to a large number of the mechs that ben gives you which explains that we are just doing things like deforesting their habitats taking their sets of resources but also it is not i would say that animals yearn for freedom animals yearn to be able to like do what they want and not to go through the horrific things that factory farming do things like sterilization are obviously terrible obviously we are the side that claims the most utility experiencing creatures final thing we tell you is that humanity will end anyway things like war and disease and note how close we've been to ending and you can't just say we haven't ended yet because but like obviously we've been incredibly close and at the point where we do that completely removes opposition bench's benefit because it means we're gonna die anyway we just explained that it is better because first there is less suffering and second we don't take the rest of the planet with us look obviously this motion is counter-intuitive but that doesn't mean this isn't a prediction game of what a person would do the average regional provider is willing to be convinced we convinced them that this would be bad boat opening government i'm the deputy minister when i find speech i'm super happy to welcome the deputy leader of the opposition hello can i be heard you can be hot i'm gonna start the speech in three two one first question what is the moral underpinning of the opening government case the first thing i want to note is they have to explain why the average person was likely to subscribe to the moral constructions they provide on opening government not that this third party benevolent actor was likely to do so i think that david has proven things that are more likely to be close to the things that an average person would believe for a few reasons firstly the same evolutionary beliefs that you have to want to be able to survive are likely to be the same ones that influence this person's particular moral framework i.e they have a belief that humanity should persist i.e they have a belief that there is a value to human life etc and therefore is far more likely to subscribe to the things david mentions not only that but we have all grown up in a society that has emphasized your willingness to think that there's value in your family your parents being alive or that there is some glory to human achievement that can be achieved in the future that you are preemptively preventing from ever occurring in this instance where the motion takes you a lot makes you particularly take on the role of an average person not one that is likely to care significantly about animal rights etc it is unclear why the constructions in government are the ones that are more likely to persist for this particular person but let's debate og and why is it that they're still morally incorrect they explain that they are far more likely to fulfill the utilitarian metric but never justify this utilitarian metric there are three problems with what they provide the first is that it is unclear why utilitarian like utilitarianism is precisely measured by the physical harm to the body i.e look at their harms starvation hunger a potential harm from other human beings what i've note is that there are people who live in poverty and do suffer physically but are still willing to determine their lives to be worthwhile still determine their lives to be incredibly meaningful and it is unclear to me therefore why the construction of whether or not humans are more likely to enjoy life feel a utilitarian value to their life is solely because of the kinds of environments and like physical pains that they go through rather than some kind of perception of the self that we think is far more likely to be important that's the second thing obviously we can't say that everyone likes their lives or think they're meaningful that's the important thing here you as an individual person have absolutely no right to play god and say that nobody's lives are worth anything and therefore they should prevent them i think the ability for a human being to determine and charge on through life and exercise a degree of agency is far more important than preemptively determining everyone is not living a white life that is worthwhile because just because there's the physical suffering of the body does not imply that there is like a lack of meaning to that life or a lack of value that life to begin with because people can still enjoy lies that they think are for example physically painful as a consequence the only response to this is you cannot meaningfully enjoy your agency the first question here is the reason for that is you are have evolutionary procedures that make you not want to have any agency of your life one obviously humans have evolved to the point of rational thought where they can conceive of themselves and the value of their lives independent of just thinking that evolutionary like behaviors are the only things that are able to determine that for them but secondly is that there are active incentives for people to create identities that no matter how arbitrary provide a significant amount of meaning to their lives independent of what your like material reality might be which is why we have things like religion which is why people are so closely related to things like sporting or have hobbies that they enjoy or things like their family and own local communities that while might not improve their material realities often give them a sense of comfort that they want to be able to subscribe to that's the last thing because they say the world is so filled with this negative utility but never way why does that outweigh all the positive utility that does exist in this world what i want to make clear here is that the determination of how positive utility and negative utility are able to outweigh each other again cannot be made by an individual in this motion that therefore should play god and say that none of your lives are worth living anyway as a consequence the moral underpinning of this case is one unproven because it's purely pathological to believe we fulfill utilitarianism is good without explaining truly what that would be the case next they say that we should like encourage and coach on your agency if it harms other people harms other forms of life the first thing i want to note here is they never engage with the comparative a human beings have forced all the factory farmed animals that they explain to have adapted and build biological features that adapt to the need for human beings so for example sheep used to be able to fully survive on their own but in status quo because humans have shaped them historically they build too much wool and will fall over and die and choke without any kind of human that is going to look after them so this motion does not say we will remove humans from the beginning it is we will remove humans at the point in history where we have built biology to be incredibly dependent on human care but secondly is what david points out is the comparative of there are so many other species that are willing to kill you willing to eat you willing to go after you and you have to wait therefore who is more likely to care about some kind of inherent life who is more likely to at least put in regulations and laws that want to be able to push for you to be killed humanely humans or other species other actors that are unlucky to make this kind of rational calculus because they have not reached that evolutionary stage and therefore will probably just eat you like i don't know what the comparative ability for other animals to get this agency is if other animals are going to eat them as well secondly they say at pm that we are a point of no return for climate change and what that implies that the deadly impacts of climate change are still incredibly likely to accrue coming from opening government the danger here therefore is that we don't know how animals are going to adapt to this however anthropogenic problems oftentimes require incredibly innovative anthropogenic solutions that only humans are able to come through and therefore all the harms of climate change to these animals if we are at a point of no return obviously cannot be reversed by them cg uh intuitions are instrumental to moral judgments utilitarianism is also justified on an integration of joy why should we prioritize your intuitions above ours as an axiom of decision making no again this is not about moral truth it is about what is the particular moral truth to this individual but moreover i've just explained why the ability to have agencies is a far more important moral like uh priority here so again climate change not likely to improve and therefore without human beings and we've already made important strides and being able to do this for all the same evolutionary needs and wants for us to be able to survive years and years into the future but lastly guys if we all disappear there are so many things you have not accounted for that can cause catastrophic damage to other lights as well all the nuclear reactors that we have absolutely no one manning anymore all the oil refineries that are likely to over spill and flow into other kinds of biodiverse areas all these things allow human intervention to prevent these kinds of harms and so forth everyone just disappears in a snap makes it incredibly likely that the environmental damage of all the things we leave behind all the fires that will be caused all the things we should have turned off before all disappearing are going to cause massive environmental damage for these reasons i think one og is incredibly uncomparative but two are unable to defend their own moral framework i'm very very proud to propose [Music] i'm super happy to call a member of government sorry am i audible you are readable yeah cool i'll tell you speech in three two one i tend to do two things first of all i'm going to explain why human existence is this utah on net regardless of whether we solve things like climate change or capitalist oppression farmers structural development in government secondly i will actually justify our choice of world metric and respond to opening oppositions actor bush let's get into it about this interval why is human existence inherently disutile first of all the mechanism of the hedonic treadmill nothing pleasurable things cause a desire for further such experiences on intuition when i started debating i thought that breaking esl at udc would be the happiest moment of my life it wasn't because what i did i wanted a semi-final i wanted a final i wanted to go through the end the problem is this cannot be rationalized the way because it's biological it works on mechanisms of dopamine and serotonin it's literally how addiction works once you get a stimulus your brain desires that stimulus but you do not have conscious control over what your brain desires biologically which is to say that you cannot control the sin initially they're impossible to be happy on that the comparative is however you cannot acclimatize negatively if i live without food i will not get used to hunger if i live without border i will not get used to thirst and we do not get used to our unhappiness and our sadness which is to say we tend towards unhappiness regardless of the context of which we exist and regardless of evolution but secondly even if our experiences are positive or net human cognition prioritizes negative experiences and building heuristics because their defense mechanism if my romantic partner had cheated on me then in my next relationship i'm going to see cheating patterns even if they're not there i'm going to behave in a controlling manner potentially ruin my relationship because in order to do that insofar as i want to protect myself against future analogous experiences on the comparative focusing on positive experiences makes us makes us more relaxed and makes us more in harm's way which is to say that we emphasize negativity we do not emphasize positivity regardless of context but the explanation of how evolution works openly government says it's evolutionary condition that's an explanation thirdly consciousness is pain regardless of context because humans exist in numerous incomprehensible intertwined systems that they cannot predict and they cannot understand the weather which we can only predict two days in advance the idea of creation how were we created and what are the moral implications of that geography and natural disasters human behavior itself we seek reason but we never find it unpredictability screws over our lives again and again i've experienced two earthquakes in a pandemic i can tell you very well about it which is why we live lives of fear we are happiest for the two weeks when we go to the seaside and we long for predictability we hope nothing unpredictable happens and then we just save ourselves we are happy with this for 14 days made the year worth it that's not what we experienced for the other 340 and something days but lastly death itself at the point where you are dying at the point where you know that you will die you are old and or you are sick this consumes all else because you fear the idea of pain you fear the void as per all of the mechanisms opening opposition gives you you fear the idea of nothing less than leaving all of the lord your loved ones behind as the opening opposition describes what does this mean this means that a universal experience all humans go through at the end of their lives consumes all of their positive experiences the utilities only experienced in the present the last present we experience is death that present is this utah we remove that at the point where people's existence is erased regardless of them being aware of it because it just happens which is to say that is the largest disutility that all humans have to face which will remove this answers mikko's question of why negativity necessarily has to outweigh positivity because it's structural to all humans far beyond opening government but don't worry opposition bench i do intend to justify our choice of metric in this debate because co does pose a legitimate poi why do we stand behind utilitarianism the first reason why we stand behind it is because it's impossible to ascertain the inherent value of people's preference i.e to claim that one is more objectively valuable than the other even if that truth exists in a vacuum our faculties are not sufficient to access that truth insofar as our attempt to determine metrics of the search would be infected by our own subjective consciousness experience and desires which means that as epistemic actors the only thing we can divert with something universal and experiential that all actors go through i.t the maximization of total happiness and the minimization of total unhappiness the comparative and the alternative is the ontology but the ontology necessarily begs the question which is to say the anthology is based on the premise that some things are inherently wrong the question is why are they wrong lying is wrong is it sometimes it feels bad but it might be a good thing sometimes they're culturally imposed like they did we revolt ourselves towards homosexuality because that's what religion tells us opening opposition asks you to arbitrarily prioritize intuition over intuition the intuition of revulsion or of the desire to exist above the intuition of suffering they do not give a justification for that the comparative is all humans experience utility we can use tools like arithmetics to determine utility it's something we all go through and therefore is a more reason-based mechanism but the second justification is if this is an after motion when we encounter the button we assume the role of proxy we begin to act as a representative of the individuals for whom we make the decision at the point where we cannot confer with them we need to defer to the best possible approximation of what we think is utah as opposed to this utah given the arguments have given you before it's likely and given that also people themselves experience a lot of this utility it is likely it's more persuasive to conclude it's also statistically true because most people are statistically born into poverty and you're going to see this in sixth grade geography it is more likely that you're going to remove this utility more than you would remove utility the same goes for politicians when they approximate people's preferences when they do policy the same goes for parents when they approximate children's preferences which is to say insofar as you have this proxy you have a duty to go for utilitarianism insofar as no other moral metric is accessible to you we justify the moral metric as opposed to opening government but opening opposition says ah actor motion i have four responses to this first of all as for the world's manual actors still have moral obligations regardless of their perspectives secondly instead of you can prove the benefits of the actor in 15 minutes we've come up with them and proven them in seven dylan has seven more we can persuade the accuracy good for them but thirdly not if intuitions are only shortcuts intuitions are something we do on a whim but this is an incredibly hard moral decision you act on behalf of entirety of humanity people are more likely to consider higher order reasoning and to take time to go over the decision that people sacrifice themselves for values even though it's inherently irrational to be dead that's why people are willing generals in war are willing to allow syrian civilians to be bombed for more people to survive haha conveniently utilitarianism before i give my fourth response i'll engage with opening opposition the whole problem with utilitarianism is that it is impossible to assume what people think is you tile for them and our whole point is that utility is built on preference hence you cannot defer to some value that you decide for other people if it's impossible to assume then your case becomes a non-starter to the same extent to which you claim the government cases because you cannot assume that your decision is the correct one either which means to break this deadlock you need to find a common ground which to defer to which are in which are arguments and conditions which apply to humanity universally regardless of context and therefore abstracted from subjectivity the four reasons i gave on top of my speech you can't win this debate the fourth justification is as i said you italianism tends to be more intuitive than all the other reasons i've explained that before last short response on animals because open government doesn't do it so i'll defend their case so i can win animals that are bred for food will die anyway because we kill them there are tens of thousands of species that are not bred for food we've seen these species revitalized during the corporate pandemic it is factual that they thrive i don't know how open opposition claimed differently but also og doesn't give the justification for this why killing humans instead of anything else the reparatory principle we must give what was taken away we've taken away not just their habitat we kill them we take away their lives insofar as we take away complete integrity complete integrity must be given back the body must be given for the body that's the justification for the opening government principle i've never been prouder to stand on the government bench i'm the member of government for their fine speech and i'm super happy to welcome the member of opposition great can i confirm i'm clearly audible you are fairly audible great starting in three two one i'm going to win on deontology and then i'm going to win on utility but first i'm going to explain why we weigh over opening this debate for three reasons first their cases contingent on a series of assertions about the mental state of the person we do not have epistemic access to that person may be depressed that person might have the world view of opening and closing government or hold a similar worldview and i guess to that that person might be utility monster and even though you probably can't calculate the absolute agility of erasing humanity in terms of the utilitarian metrics given on gov bench i imagine they might think they can there are many reasons to believe that a person might want to push the button we genuinely don't know even if they prove that probabilistically they might be more likely to second even if you feel guilty as opening government observes this harm is incredibly short term we're going to outweigh on scale and explain why guilt is short term but the harm you inflict on every human that ever could exist in the future is larger third their practical cases contingent on humankind being able to cope with the current problems we're facing like climate change and so on we're not sure maybe opening government is right maybe it will nuke everyone they might they might not our case won't be contingent on either we'll explain why the moral harm you in present individual is massive and you ought to not do that firstly on the deontology why is this profoundly principally unjust tin already did the actor motion weighing thing but given that this is an active debate from the perspective of the average intelligence voter that doesn't mean that you as an individual don't have obligations to be other people around you that is your state your family your friends your human community and so on and so forth you likely care about this but even more than that insofar as you are an individual who can reason those things we can persuade you that you ought to care about this first dylan and a poi to o say it is unclear which moral framework is epistemically correct this is true but they probably don't have time in the moment also to do cost-benefit analysis on whether or not you actually aggregate out utility insofar as you cannot accurately assess um this in the moment i claim you have a moral obligation to defer to leaving humanity alive why firstly most people have a revealed preference for being alive and you know most people have revealed preference for life to your life this is why most people continue to exist opening government says ah it's just biological so i have no idea why that matters in so far as that's their preference you should not violate it secondly there is no opt-out ability for non-existence but there is an opt-out ability from existence there are things like voluntary euthanasia that are becoming more normalized in society and socially acceptable for people who want to rationally opt out there are still mechanisms by which you can do so the comparative is there is no opt-out ability for non-existence because you never exist in the first place you're you are a blank slate there is nothing in the world that you ever existed you have no ability to choose finally there are coping mechanisms that exist for the harms of existence these coping mechanisms are huge therapy family friends consoling people all these things are people can access i think in terms of minimizing harm and importantly minimizing the harm in the moment we win but secondly in order to push the button you have to believe you are doing humanity in the world of favor even if this is the morally optimal choice by some metric which we cannot calculate i think it is always wrong to use everyone else's life as a means to an end in order to change social progress gov might say ah we instrumentalize people all the time they have to pay taxes and so on to the state i think that firstly this is less in scale not the absolute horror of being used as a means to an end by your very existence being extinguished in order to achieve some social progress secondly even if it is the same scale taxes or even like military service are not every facet of your identity that is it's fine for me to instrumentalize ahmed by ordering pizza for him but even if we don't know he doesn't want it but it's wrong for me to take moral agents and solely treat them as a means to end this is why you can't take the organs out of someone in a hospital and kill him to save the lives of five others in the same way it's not just to kill all humans to save 5000 animals not only do our moral intuitions align with this i think that insofar as um their claim is this is morally util in some way because we went on utility this principle supersedes utility because we provide an alternate metric to explain why utilitarianism is wrong but thirdly you are likely to believe that this is an active moral good to bring life into the world this is because most of us value children consider these things and our conception is right to the state claim that you have more obligations to future generations i.e this is where our philosophical ideas and intuitions about paying into things like welfare systems over the years or raising children or paying for public schools the next generation can be educated or fighting climate change because we believe that children are important i think not only do you believe this to be true but you fail an obligation that you have to bring life into the world to continue that perpetuation and insofar as you cannot accurately access the preferences of every individual who would exist on our side if you don't press this button that is however many millions of people that would come into the world you have to for my first analysis defer to the fact that they would have chosen because of the people who would not there are opt-out mechanisms there are coping mechanisms but there's no opt-out no coping mechanism and no ability uh not to choose on their side of the house second claim why do we win on utility what is the unique moral value of human experience i think firstly utilitarianism is probably unclear if you can access ultimate utilitarianism on gov bent or human erasure on non-human actors some species will go instinct and die some species won't i'm not sure who's right there figure that out in discussion but opening opposition say that it it's an attack on agency but don't explain why it's morally important the reason it's wrong is to amplify every harm on og in order to weigh any argument in og in this debate you have to believe restrictions on agents are bad this is the reason we consider and they consider capitalism on the crusades to be bad because they rob people the ability to access agency and their conception of the good life so on their own principled framework we flip this because all of their reasons for why humanity are is on net disutil flip at the point where you erase all human who chants that human experience ever rectifying those inequities so they create a greater moral inequity in the attempt to solve lesser order moral inequities but second i think there's something uniquely valuable at human existence that you cannot weigh off even against other animals note that every conception of the good life we have as human beings is predicated first on existence that is for me to experience any positive emotion i must first exist my ability to fall in love to walk down the road and spill flowers to stare at gorgeous sunsets or a new snowfall it's contingent on me being able to think and appreciate those things i must first be existing in order to think those thoughts are exercise that capacity this means that any positive utility i can experience and any moral framework i can ever evaluate is contingent first on my ability to exist note that these positive experiences are unique and distinct from animals insofar as firstly to the best of our knowledge the level of sections that human beings possess is unique it is unclear whether other animals possess the same degree of reflexivity and their intelligence to experience and appreciate beauty and strength the same way and even they do we don't know if they have a capacity experience and express the same way so it can never truly be verified the comparative is the harm of killing all humans can be verified we know that they express the higher order capacity thoughts because they have documented proof of that ability express their thoughts so killing those individuals is harmful because we raise a unique moral agent from the world secondly each positive human experience is unique because each human being is a unique world value with infinite dignity emotion and inner world that is unique valuable and distinct from every other human being the intuition is why we consider individual human rights to be important and every individual equally valuable we don't know if any animal or any other being that could exist or will exist has an internal world of this scale and magnitude so when you erase all humanity you are erasing a key facet of experience that might never exist in the world elsewhere before i spend the final implication of this opening up the problem with this agency argument is that you need to prove people actually consent on your side we explain that people are born with an arbitrary aversion to death and therefore are without their consent exposed to all these staggering harms that we the difference is as i have explained ad nauseam in my speech because that's opt-out coping and other forms of ways in which you can weigh off that trade-off at the point where you don't exist you violate the consent of all the people who would choose to be alive the final thing i want to note here is that these unique experiences of every individual human aggregates together to create communities cultures and traditions these have value which is the intuition by which you consider cultural preservation to be good and colonism to be bad which og can see they think is important when they talk about the crusades you end all of those things prior to them and you end the agglomeration of moral value in human exchange these are forms of moral expression you cannot weigh because each culture is individually valuable and you don't have epistemic access to determine which is more or less value but also reparatory principle that tim talks about you take away that reparatory principle insofar as there's any progress for reparations for black people for slavery you short circuit that at the point which the net moral harm has been done to black people is empirically greater than the rectification that has happened so you short circuit any chance of the moral arc of history bending for justice when you argue for voluntary extinction finally this is an infinite utility harm why because it's not just you don't come into existence it's that every potential human culture or every interaction that any human culture could ever have between different experiences is erased forever these are unique benefits that we know about we do not know what the benefits or harms to animals will ultimately be in that comparison these are unique experiences that you erase forever incredibly proud to win from closing up a thirdly memorable position for their speech it's now time for the whip speeches starting with dublin whip you are audible not to be born is best for our best to come before next best when born with without delay is traced the backward way what is the moral framework by which we should evaluate this debate opening opposition say it's the actor's perspective i think firstly this is a grey area vis-a-vis the rules of british parliamentary debating but i don't care about those rules too much so i'm going to engage in this clash anyways the more important thing though is that an active motion is not a predictive evaluation of what an actor will do otherwise debating would be completely pointless it is given a set of certain values how can we a shape those values or b best fulfill those values we say a given person with no set preferences no set cultural background and knowledge that a priori position approaching this debate can be persuaded by claims within the context of this debate because of the premise of debating within the first place noting here there are values that they have our intuitions in the first place these intuitions are universally applied across people they are nonetheless intuitions we propose to you in closing opposition that not only are intuitions things like the revulsion from opening opposition i'm using revolution as a by word for the conglomerate that they outlined there because they all resolve back that person first perspective versus utilitarianism the universal perspective that we propose to you in closing government what best persuades them is the next question we propose to you that is utilitarianism there's a responses to opening opposition but also like whippington's analysis the first to say is that the intuitions that they talk about nobody else's are culturally defined so you can point to for example the fact that some people find homosexuality to be revulsive and some indeeds don't secondly you can find that it has mistaken triggers because obviously the way in which intuitions present themselves are a proxy by which we can make moral judgments in the time we don't have to consider the decision itself which is to say that oftentimes we believe something is wrong and yet do it anyways which is to say oftentimes hang a lie feels revulsive but we do it anyway for the consequences that would happen as a as a result of making that live the honest line the noble lie the third thing to say is that there's an arithmetic perspective here which is to say if you take these subjective evaluations and the different intuitions that individuals might have there's no way to weigh up those intuitions if there are fundamentally subjective evaluations it's just what feels strongest to the actor in the individual moment we provide you the idea that because not only isn't is is utilitarianism based off of an intuition of joy being good and suffering being bad that everyone universally can tap into but it can also be used arithmetically to make evaluations thereafter which is to say because it is a as it is inter-subjective and therefore approximates objectivity you can do things like weighing up the net utility that exists within humanity you can't weigh up revulsions and preferences in the same kind of way we propose to you that you use these kind of intuitions of the shorthand moral value but in instances where an individual has a large like decision to make are indeed the largest decision that any human has ever made throughout the course of human history they'll take time to consider it beyond just what their intuitions unfaith tell them they will consider the question more deeply using the tools and history of philosophers that they have considered within the context of their life to make those kinds of decisions as a consequence then they're willing to be open to the arguments that we present before the house co says there's a had the anthology but the problem with this is of course technology fundamentally begs the question the idea of they say ah reciprocity is a good thing but why is reciprocity a fundamentally good thing well you should bring it back to the natural state why should you do that etc the reason why utilitarianism is a fundamentally valuable model framework here is where that a takes on the intuition which means that you're not just creating an assertive moral framework but b can be evaluative in in that kind of sense as well using arithmetic evaluations which means it is the kind of decision that someone ought to and indeed would defer to in instances that are irrelevant in the context of this debate which is why we unlock the actor analysis and also mechanize the claims on this perspective but also to know in response to closing opposition when they say that there's no opt-out of non-existence that's obviously untrue insofar as that individual that could have been born does not exist it's called the non-identity problem in philosophy i'm sure ahmed has read about it because i sent him a paper about it before i'm sure his responses will be decent here but the problem here therefore is because there is no moral value that can accrue to a non-existent actor by definition of them not existing you can't consider the fact that they can't opt out to be a moral harm and therefore ceo's case in this is unpersuasive when they say that an individualism means to an end i think firstly see if my previous analysis the reason why you might believe someone to be a means to end is based off of intuition which we've already weighed against and indeed a lot of instances we think it's reasonable for someone to be a means to an end for example for social change i do think it's fine to weaponize people for social change but also we would contend to no like everyone's existence right now is also a means to an end for the productivity of capital less general analysis animals that exist within the context of the world right now exist fundamentally towards the means for an end for individuals but i'll engage with that later therefore we propose to you that that is the best moral framework the other evaluation on this is just to say that when closing opposition say that every individual has a unique perspective that is not an immoral claim but just an evaluative claim and therefore it means that you cannot wait against them mechanizing a subjectivity claim but also when they say that people have intuitions against death i would note that in a lot of instances people agree with euthanasia when instances when instances of someone's like being inherently or like like a visibly a utility negative we think it's fine for them to choose death we can prove to you that utility is negative we are able to mechanize that evaluation in the individual's mindset and therefore win from closing government and which side do we get more suffering opening governments say two things if evolution i think firstly give no analysis with regards to evolution as to why we can't adapt to beat that evolution we weren't involved to debate on laptops and yet here we are tim uniquely tries to provide this analysis by explaining why cognition is a fundamentally torturous activity because we are always seeking for rationality and cannot find it we are always pondering the question of death and cannot answer it but secondly when he explains through the hedonic treadmill analysis which explains to you that even in a context that's radically outside of our evolution we're still constrained by our evolution filling in that gap from opening government secondly with regards to capitalism it's just not true in all instances but it's also general analysis they never explained to us why the technique which we should use to engage with capitalism at the end of the world in and of itself as opposed to just engaging generally in social activism to try to ameliorate that overall we prove more fundamental and universal things on this basis opening opposition say two things they say aha agency and ceo repeat this i know that we only care about agency insofar as exists within the human condition which is we believe that as a human actor it is immoral to infringe upon an individual individual's agency that's why we think that there's no moral obligation to have as many kids as you possibly can is why we think that disability is not immoral but but restricting disabled individuals from getting access against civility is an immoral thing because you're restricting their agency with regards to the state in which they are before i move on opening yes actors can consider moral obligations but either moral frameworks that they've constructed for themselves and not ones we've made up to this debate our point is that despite that no argument could convince most people out of killing their children and their best friends and everyone they've ever loved preparing anything debating has evolved to the point where we have to assume the same level of ignorance as an actor i don't want to get through the semi-final but i think our case has already dealt with it in terms of accommodation as closing opposition repeats from opening opposition i would like to note that our analysis here works because these claims only target opening government who are able to explain to you that there are just certain descriptive conditions that means that an individual experience pain and therefore the accommodation for that pain and the adaptation to that that pain that opposition invented outline targets them it does not target us who outline fundamental considerations which means that an individual cannot evade the pain of existence in the first place final question is on external effects obviously if it's an active motion who cares secondly if it's utilitarianism we would say that we create a great reset because even if opening opposition are right that nuclear war erase the entirety of animality they're able to adapt to it going forward to the future and create a natural habitat in which they can thrive far away from the human conditions we oppose upon them with they have no evolutionary capacity to understand it defeats the fear and suffering if the entourage the responsibility argument lands envy sedition strife carnage and our utmost desires tell the tale of life we would we would urge you to propose this motion because we believe that humanity has failed oh my god for that fine speech and to conclude this semi-final i'm happy to call on the opposition whip hey everyone am i audible yeah you're audible but become closer to your microphone but it's still is this better uh yeah it'll do i'm sure it's fine great uh if i become inaudible please let me know for poise put them in the chat don't verbally interrupt um with that being said matt can you start great three two one no matter how beautiful and well crafted a coffin might look it will never make anyone wish for death i'm going to weigh against oo and then do a little bit on cg and then kind of wash out the top half a bit more oh no in actor motions we act as angels on the shoulders of the actor we do not literally take up the mind of the actor because that's that's what makes it a debate convincing them what they ought to why does that matter they need to explain why the actor should care about those individual biases not that they simply have these biases why does matt wins their analysis at best says you should do you should do this because some moral uh will make you feel guilty if you don't matt says that the fact that you had to take any action for someone else to avoid guilt is instrumentalizing them and that you as an actor has obligations and should care about those obligations matt explains why you likely believe in these obligations because of a duty to future generations a duty to not instrumentalize people in a truly terrible way for societal benefit matt's second extension is also far more comparative to gov because he doesn't rely on a conception of morals via taxologies like this is like murder and murder is wrong matt adds particular nuance that utility outside the effects of humidity on this motion is very speculative it is possible that you will be able to save some animals all gob and some animals might die on off the problem is they just assume that every moral agent has precisely the same utility matt explains what is unique about human beings existing and being able to exist that provision them with unique value matt explains the unique things that set human beings apart i.e reflexivity and thought the uniqueness of human beings as a social animal the uniqueness of each human's interior world matt explains when taken together these phenomena constitute a unique moral obligation that has moral value and therefore why you as an actor like me care about it matt explains why no matter if you believe gov bench wins on utility which is inherently speculative is morally wrong to use people as a means to an end in totality now i'm going to take on cg note i think if i rebut cg it's also rebutting og insofar as og rely on a justification for why utility ought to be the metric and why humanity is structurally suffering so if i rebut the best case of og which is cg i also beat og in the process on cg they give four mechanisms for a human existence is structurally suffering firstly the hedonic treadmill i would note that one humans have developed large coping mechanisms to do with it i.e narratives that say try your best and it's fine if you fail or having a friend that tells you it's okay secondly they presume humans have no capacity for managing those expectations on the human treadmill that is to say i know that matt will never love me but i manage my expectation to just be his friend because it will make me happier thirdly there are large distractions that fight breaks and meaning and allow you to like escape and take a break from running on the treadmill but fourthly the hedonic treadmill harms note are uniquely tied to things that are clearly measurable i.e debate comes as the example used in mg but it doesn't apply to the large range of human experiences where you cannot really compare them between each other that is to say your ability to find solace and being a good father or a friend or the moment you fall in love and the butterflies you feel in your stomach in that moment it's unclear why the hedonic treadmill operates at every point in life like they say secondarily they say you emphasize more negative experiences because of like via heuristics i would again say that there have been coping mechanisms to deal with this like therapy for it or narratives that tell you to look on the bright side but i would actually flip it i think humans actually focus on the positive more why one i'll use og's evolutionary mech and steal it and say it's because they want to avoid depression and being suicidal so they focus on the bright side but do humans want to feel valuable and better about themselves and the life they've lived but thirdly humans interact with other human beings that don't like bad vibes so they're likely to reinforce more positive experiences and make them laugh thirdly they say you cannot predict the world which leads to suffering i think there's actually finding beauty in the unpredictability what will i do tomorrow who will i meet it makes every moment special because you don't know what's going to happen to it at worst if you don't buy that there are enough annoying sunny and bright people that i just mentioned like this that make this mechanism unlikely to be wholly representative and structural as cg say fourthly they say at the point of death it consumes all positive utility so at that present point it is therefore makes the rest of your life feel like  because at that point you're so scared one they note assert that it is a negative experience is because things are about to end here's why it's likely positive one you look at a life well lived with family by your deathbed because people around you want to make you feel like like as if your life mattered or secondarily there's lots of excitement about what's next who will i will i see the rest of my family in the afterlife where will i go to will i be reincarnated or thirdly i think this is addresses the more structural part people naturally develop coping mechanisms to look at death positively narratives that glorify the elderly the upside of all of this they give reasons for why there are moments of people to be sad and why they can be sad but not why it is certain that the aggregate negative is in fact more than the aggregate positive let's say you don't buy that why should the metric not be utility which also takes out the premise og relies on they say utility is the only metric all humans are universally capable of the intuition everybody shares one this principle is again contingent on the proving that there is more suffering or a probability and a clear probability there's more suffering to take this action which i made unclear but secondarily it's entirely contingent of being able to measure and quantify people's utility and suffering you literally cannot accurately measure people's utility on the grand scale that this motion requires which is unique to other scenarios because one you literally do not have access to their actual minds and how they value the rest of their life and their self-actualization secondarily it's dynamic people's utility changes from time to time clearly it's way differently between different people and 40 people cannot communicate particular emotions at all points because they may lack the language the upshot is that the criteria they use and would you rely on is one that they cannot even win on because they can't measure or quantify or even weigh it between people and say whether it's more or less but if it is you tell matt also wins on that if you can measure utility because matt explained why humans get more utility out of existence than insects insofar as you cannot assess the scale of animal suffering on either side you can measure utility human beings derived from cultures life etc so on all metrics we'd be teaching there for og but i'll give them a chance right now py uh py og og you're gonna make one abstract debate where people drone on about nerdy philosophy og provides the clearest and most concrete harm which is people suffering under war genocide capitalist depression and an evolutionary coded badness clearly yeah this is perfect the reason why you're going to lose is because nerds read philosophy and you probably should read philosophy but let's now take out their case the top half clash in whether society is becoming better or worse which leads to the kind of human suffering that oh rely on partially but oh you rely on a lot it's impossible for you to make the adjudication on this why because one relies on major structural forces that exist inside it that we don't have every particular information about secondarily things that we structurally cannot have information about i.e one the incentives of other powerful actors and how they will change the world i.e the cia and the info they have or what jeff bezos's next plans are or b people's preferences on the ground you cannot fully predict how they'll react to for example like like like decreasing resources but clearly the interaction effects of all these things maybe some info about scarce resource maybe like there's uh like people will be scared about scarce resources but how does this interact with the development of technology will technology be widely available or restricted you cannot know how these major structural forces even if you know some of them interact with the ones that you do not know and what to do you'll solve climate change the upside of all of this is that analysis that explains whether humanity will improve or not in animals is incredibly uncertain and speculative not to say it doesn't matter in their own i don't want to be one of those things that says top half washes out but that analysis contingent on it analysis that is contingent on it has to matter less because there's so many assumptions you have to make in order to buy those impacts never been prouder to oppose i'd say we won from op whip but matt one from memo the opposition whip for their fighters speech and everyone was genuinely very good debate uh congratulate each other and yourselves uh we will now adjudicate everyone you know please leave it's your best incentive to do so we can finish quickly
