Transcript:
 yep audio is great cool starting in three uh py's in chat by the way um i'll try to take one around three two one we're going to be talking about three things in opening government today firstly why this veto is a principally legitimate exercise for these unions and organizations to have secondly why you get more qualified nominees and checks and balances over the policy making process and thirdly why you get better policy making in terms of a model the way we imagine this veto would work is as an additional mechanism to complement existing approval measures already in place so when a president or prime minister appoints a judge to an appellate court it still has to be confirmed by the corresponding legislature in that region or nationally when an education minister is appointed it's still being confirmed by parliamentary congress this operates as an additional veto power that goes to the corresponding industry i.e a teachers union an industrial labor relations union something like that secondly we envision there are significant degrees of political costs you can incur from using this too often which means that it is likely that these uh unions will actually exercise this veto power sparingly firstly because it can cause degrees of antagonism if you over veto in policy secondly in many instances lobbying exists within these groups which means that there is likely going to be use of this as a first tool in order to influence policy we think it's relatively likely that this v2 has exercised somewhat sparingly thirdly the veto probably can't be overridden in most instances i suppose theoretically in some instances if you get like a two-thirds majority in the in the senate or something like this you could get a review and maybe there could be another another uh corresponding thing but in most cases we think the veto is final uh why do we think this is specifically a principally legitimate exercise i think this argument is probably the most important in the debate because i think if we can prove that these people deserve to have a mechanism control over the kinds of people who get appointed in their industry we win the debate i think this is a principally legitimate exercise because it rectifies imbalances and representation that exists between specific industries note that this motion probably has very little delta in cases where it's like a very big business organization for example the chamber of commerce in the united states will likely always have a massive amount of exercise over who gets appointed to the ministries of commerce and things like that it's very unlikely you're going to get a minister of commerce who isn't very pro-business on either side of the house because these lobbying groups have massive amounts of power where this debate has a delta is in instances where there is an unbalance in representation i.e in union power where teachers unions have significantly less ability because they have significantly less financial capital than other interests in order to appoint a teachers union person who is likely to regulate these things in a manner that is favorable them i.e an industrial and labor relations where you might get very anti-union representatives and unions have no mechanism of control over the state to the same degree i think this operates as a mechanism control over state appointments with otherwise would not exist for specific industries i.e where organized labor which is often under assault in many developed capitalist countries getting a measure of control over who gets appointed i think this is important on a principal level because the state is extremely coercive and so far as it controls every facet of your life you have no opt-out and it is inescapable and in so far as this is true we think it is principally legitimate to give these people an additional mechanism of control over that appointment why is this needed addition to voting i think that firstly voting is always asymmetric right you get limited choices over who which kind of policymaker that gets appointed you cannot predict who the person you voted for will choose over each appointment that is you can choose obama as president but you don't know who obama is going to point as education secretary so this policy operates on a more granular level secondly this is far more specific form of control over the state than voting because it deals with specific regulation that is industry specific i.e you don't know what kind of like minister education guidelines are going to be passed like title ix policy or things like this but these teachers unions do and have a significantly greater degree of awareness and information about them thirdly these industries are far more asymmetrically affected by the kinds of policy than the general public so vote you might be able to vote a ton of people into power and they might be generally a good representative for most people's political interests but at the point which it functions on a more granular level you need to rectify those representational imbalances she's going to degree finally lobbying is always asymmetric because some industries have more power in lobbying over others if you're a country with a very strong manufacturing sector i.e the malaysian rubber industry that industry is always going to have more power than other industries in malaysia so what this does is it gives other industries a rectifying thing to rectify that power and balance that exists through lobbying it makes representation comparatively more equal even if we're not perfect so we are better fulfilling this principle on our side of the house on non-contingent grounds in this debate even if opposition proves that somehow there is some third order practical harm resulting from this we already win this debate but why do we get significantly more qualified nominees for each position i think the first thing we do is we reduce politicization over the confirmation process significantly there are three broad ways this happens firstly in status quo confirmation of nominees with these positions rests with the party in power i if you have a parliament in the uk with a tory majority you can effectively appoint whoever you want this means you get less vetting comparatively over each political appointment because these people are vetting for specific things like alignment with political interests for example i.e they want to know if the education minister is going to pass the education policy that is aligned with this specifically the labor party's uh political positions for example or the conservative party's political positions the comparison is that these political organizations have interests that are orthogonal to that they probably care far more about what they're going to do for specifically i don't know teaching policy or curricular standardization or things that political appointees might not care about to the same degree so insofar as these interests diverge that is the political interests and the interests of the union we get comparatively more ability to have those both those interests take into account and to veto people who are specifically problematic but secondly the bar association and teachers unions probably want to be able to work with multiple administrations that is to say they want consistency and regulation because the pendulum swings back and forth when you go from extremely strong anti-union policy to extremely pro-union policy that causes issues with compliance and cost those unions tons of money what this means is there's likely to be a race to the median in terms of regulation or even more moderate policy being pushed for where they veto particularly extreme nominees on one end of the political spectrum or the other because they don't want to deal with the fall of those extreme nominees appointing some kind of policy that's incredibly extremist then that getting rolled back by another successive nominee later on down the line so this means that you took it's used in such a way that's more moderate thirdly certain industries have massive asymmetries of power i.e in terms of selection the industries that bank or girls do in the status quo can lobby governments to get appointments when you chose over these specific policy making this operates as a check and balance against that kind of lobbying to a significantly greater degree i think that's principally legitimate see my earlier point but it's also practically legitimate because now you're likely to get more policy that probably benefits vulnerable groups probably benefits the working class twisting of a greater degree so it operates as additional mechanism of control finally bar associations and teachers unions are full of people with deep level awareness and knowledge about the position because their way of education they have specific experience conforming to educational doctrines especially legal doctrines your comparative is now you get less people with absolutely no knowledge and so on and so forth before i explain the implications about ceo out of order sorry no worries uh i think what this does finally in terms of changing the impact of that final thing is that it's very hard now to appoint someone with absolutely no knowledge for example a patronage appointment probably doesn't happen to the same degree on their side of the house what this means is that you get like in the absolute worst cases in corrupt states for example far fewer patronage appointments because these people aren't seen as like unqualified are seen as unqualified for example they get vetoed by that nominee to a significantly greater degree how does this change policymaking i think that firstly the people who get appointed probably are get more informed policymaking that's representative of this interest but secondly during the confirmation process they have to justify a deep level of awareness and knowledge about that kind of thing to a significantly greater degree because they want to avoid that veto so even if the vita was never used we need a preemptive incentive for these people to make better and more informed policy so what happens is now voters are more aware of those kinds of policy positions that each of these appointees have that each person has but thirdly the people who want to appoint these people when they promise to appoint a specific individual that position now make credible commitments to make them make that person appointed in the first place which means more people have more leverage over the voting process as well i just think you get less antagonistic policymaking as well because the rubber stamp of approval generally means you minimize situations where these policy makers work aggressively against industry interests you probably get just less antagonism in the policy making writ large on all of these grounds incredibly practical i need to mute i need to mute myself i thank the prime minister and call the leader of up here here all right um please just offer a appeals in the chat and i will take closing government at some point i'm going to start by outlining what the counterfactual looks like for appointments and then talk about two things firstly on representation and just getting good people and then secondly about industry-wide corruption on our alternative so i think what happens under the status quo is consultation with industry experts with then having a veto power is far too much and the government ends up having the final say i want to respond to the og thing here of like awesome groups of asymmetric lobbying i think that this is a little bit odd like if you're an industrial union i'm kind of unclear why you're going to try and shape the education minister ultimately is like like presumably there's still a checking mechanism for this you're only going to want to invest the most in lobbying when you're actually approximately affected by something and if you are approximately affected by something i don't think that lobbying for a higher number of groups is actually a bad thing as i'm going to discuss my argumentation so firstly on representation i want to deal with their framing about corrupt states and advance positive material in like corrupt states with those patronage networks if anything this model just makes it worse the reason for this is that obviously the state still has an incentive to appoint patrons so they're just going to ensure that the industry experts who are now charged with the appointments and have the veto power are going to be loyalists whereas they might allow for compare comparatively more meritocracy to get good policy under the status quo our claim here is that industry experts represent a very small subset of what is best for their own industry and for society at large whereas a state is a far better mechanism to aggregate interest why is the state able to successfully collectivize preferences firstly as og concedes there tends to be scrutiny that's applied to the individual processes of when people are selected so given that a lot of people care about things like justice even a lot of people care about things like education because you're impacted by these issues potential does not allow the government to go rogue and they monitor each individual appointment that tends to take place what this means is that there's an inherent feedback mechanism that's created to the state because obviously there's an implicit incentive to appoint people who are going to be aligned with what the public interest ultimately is to avoid creating political backlash in that regard secondly though even if there's not immediate scrutiny the dominant party in power is a reflection of what the majority of people within that state wants and coalition governments smaller parties will also have a say over these things so by extension you were representing people who initially voted for that party in some kind of in some kind of ideological basis on the comparative what is the problem with industry experts and are they not representative firstly they have an incentive to campaign with what is best for their industry rather than what is best for society or at large this is for quite intuitive reasons so this is where like their own job is being protected but more importantly this is where they get their maintain of support from people this is just the industry that they've grown up in and they're probably just ideologically or undocumented to believe is the most important industry when this means that a union leader for example you are probably going to prioritize like economic well-being of not having things like factories shut down or not outsourcing factories over what is best for the environment because your own people your own ideology tends to side with that particular thing on the comparative the state is a far better mechanism to aggregate preferences because you're not just tied to a particular industry whether you're tied to representing people who have a broader diversity of what their preferences ultimately are so if people on the ground care about environmental policy you might have an incentive to appoint somebody's going to control a certain like group of unions who also has pro-environmental policy even if the remainder of people within that union don't support that as large of an extent og tries to preempt this by being like this doesn't matter because people within the industry are most proximately affected that is not true like every single industry has wide sweeping societal implications like the education industry is literally about adopting every single child within your state when it comes to things like economic industry and unions there's negative externalities when it comes to like taxation or environmental pollution of all of their policies that impact everyone so that i think that then the most fair thing to do is to defer to the collectivization of preferences secondly though a lot of these positions just involve very subjective moral tradeoffs or any degree of technical knowledge and expertise is one that is broadly irrelevant so the question for example of the degree to which religion should be incorporated into school curriculums is not really one where i think like any educational kind of minister has any more epistemic access to than people on the ground who are winging their competing priorities and their competing ideologies ultimately are so democratizing this process is substantially more fair the third observation here is that industry experts don't even represent their entire industries but rather it's a very select group of people the exact same power dynamic issues that open in government talks about just cross-apply toward our case let's think about who are the people who tend to become like industry experts they're often older people and they're often privileged people the reason for this is that in order to rise to the top it requires a lot of connections that tend to take time to be able to cultivate um you need to be like likeable in order to get people to like you which often just coalesce around like white man within these industries to a massive extent meaning they're often just older and privileged people to a massive degree and therefore their ideology is likely to be distorted in favor of that because they have lived experiences that are approximately true like related to that in the first place i don't really think it's about a demographic issue that's just think that it's like one subset of the industry might be more powerful so if we're talking about things like teachers unions just cross-supply od's analysis in a state that might be slightly like religious and the religious teachers union should have substantially more power because they get more funding from like religious species fall off an incentive to have they'll be industry experts who afford their own thing even though for the bottom of the industry a higher number of people tend to be secular the end point of this argument is that in so far as policies impact a very very wide number of people it is necessary to get policies that are going to be in the best interest of a wider subset of people before i continue we'll take cg do you think that most property capitalist system was acquired to just sleep um sure i really understood the relevance of that okay on industry-based corruption um i think that industry leaders are always going to have an incentive to push for under regulation of their own respective sectors up firstly just regulation always tends to conflict with like the bottom line of their industry to a massive accident given that they often just get a lot of paid kickbacks they don't want that it also tends to be unpopular with people in the industry themselves who will fear that like their jobs will be kicked out on the ground meaning that they're going to probably have an incentive to veto any degree of political appointment who are going to campaign for higher degree of regulation i think that then like the prop response this is like otherwise you're going to regulate the state this is substantially more difficult to be able to do firstly there's just a wider number of interest groups who are constantly lobbying the state so it's difficult to distort your own policy priority relative to the policy priority of like others um which is like just the main reason in terms of why this is asymmetric in terms of the degree of how easy it is to be able to regulate people as a consequence of this i want to know that these people have a large degree of power in terms of enforcing the amount of regulation that exists even if this otherwise decided in legislation like yes you can legislate regulation but it's ultimately often dependent on industry-based enforcement to carry out that regulation especially because state bureaucracies are often terrible and and therefore they often cooperate with political appointments within the industry to actually be able to grassroots carry out the regulation that's occurring on the ground i don't think what we're likely to see is insane over regulation because there's still some incentives to like offset this when it could conflict with bottom lines but a better balance of what regulation is this is necessary because constantly under regulating industries can create a variety of negative externalities so in the financial sector for example having scrutiny over things like accounting sheets and balance sheets to ensure that derivatives are being sold to people aren't just like nonsense instruments that are going to lead to some kind of crisis happening in the future where social media companies not giving other people's data fair of fair rulings when it comes to things like judges minimum wage laws rather than just campaigning for things like chronic under taxation and policies are just going to benefit larger corporations i think that then having some degree of regulations makes a better balance between offsetting negative externalities that can hurt people on the ground but secondly here i think the world just creates an issue where like the political leaders always have an incentive to suck up to the industry leaders where the industry leaders are not necessary for their own reappointment creating an additional channel of how corruption works because even if there is sufficient regulation you're not going to comply to that and there's a risk of pissing off industry leaders but it's just other broad things like personal facts and favors that can conflict with the general interest of your industry very proud to change the opening opposition i think the hello and call the dpm here am i audible yep audio is great great for pois please put them in the chat don't verbally interrupt throws me off making sure my video is on great that being said uh three two one before i start i just want to say i think all property was justly acquired because you had to work for it and insert any other reasons if see if cg tries to not run it it's a direct knife of their opening a little bit of characterization before getting into some rebuttal i think this debate really matters at the point where the industry and states don't perfectly align that is to say if it's a strong industry like banking or steel in some countries the alternative is in fact called consultation and the minister reflects the indus the interests of the industry anyway so there's unlikely to really be much of a delta there where this debate matters is where the alternative cannot be consult consultation because there's no incentive to that is to say the industry does not have enough power within society to represent its own interests and the state doesn't care if it doesn't represent those interests adequately or efficiently i want to get into some direct rebuttal than some kind of more balanced way i want to clarify something matt didn't say that you're going to as an industrial minister interfere with the education system what matt said is that in the status quo some industries have more lobbying powers than others so naomi's right that certain interest groups with powerful lobbying will always get people in power in their respective industry i.e business and financial associations in the us for example they will always get a pro-business person in because the government is very receptive to pro-business interests but the energy education industry has substantially less lobbying power we equalize the power between different interest groups now the interest groups with the most power don't just get their way automatically in their specific sector while the other groups are not as powerful everyone has equal veto which is comparatively more fair second all of naomi's material about the state being a better aggregator of preference is true symmetrically because the majority of people in the state still get to select the politicians who do the appointments the difference is now interest groups which are not currently in power have a mechanism of self-defense and rectify representation and the intuition pump here is for example we don't do everything via majoritarian decision making where the majority of people get to decide everything else for the minorities for example we have like minority protections that exist that represent disproportionate power or disproportionate influence that can affect minorities asymmetrically through the naomi's argument about asymmetric power of industry is true on their side of the house as well the difference that there are far far fewer industries that have asymmetric power and honestly we distribute that balance of power far better fourthly i think under regulation or over regulation happens more on their side as far as one might explain why the interests of business unions are to work with multiple administrations so they self-moderate because they don't want to put in radicals on either side and secondly under regulation likely happens as a consequence of politicization that matt told you or matt analyze we get less of it on corruption i think you have symmetric incentives to suck up the industry leaders for campaign donations now you suck up to more of them so there's more diversity in interest i want to do two than kind of clash because then unlike the principle on the on the principle of balanced representation op says that the industry cares only about their own industry and this gives them like a disproportionate power over things that affect everyone else note one yes they prioritize their industry but to a degree why because one of large supply chain interactions between different industries they can't just over another industry or not care about that in surprise it has lag term or time like effects or third-party effects on their own industry but secondarily by og's own analysis if these are issues that affect everyone else in society then by definition they cannot only care about their own industry but secondarily i don't think these are really issues that aren't as like a um that aren't really asymmetric between everyone i think these industry reps have disproportionate power over these industries and their members compared to other citizens why because they impact direct employment standards the long-term implication of that industry but clearly policies that affect their direct work workplace and no one else's now yes that exists with every policy and every citizen but this is a question of degree and how isolated these experts are now i don't think democracy is actually one vote and one equal slice of power insofar as the implications of this policy have particular effects on people that last longer more than others the uptrend implication is that representation is not a binary it should not be treated as such when the particular decisions are structurally asymmetric by definition of the industry but second we recognize that the industry shouldn't control it we're not saying the industry gets to make every policy for the country that would be abhorrent we recognize that would be like principally undemocratic we recognize the industry should have a balance that is to say it should be a balanced representation that recognizes asymmetric influence within those particular groups of people now on the power bounce and the more pragmatic impact op says that there might be too much power which leads to things like bad policy making or capital flight i don't think it's actually too much power but rather a balance why because no emotion says veto it means they don't get to choose them themselves they only approve they only have ability to participate and approve that process but secondarily know that this is critical the person in charge is accountable to both members the state and the industry i.e the state can remove them if they are being too schmoozy with the industry for example not being optimal with their policy the only abilities that this gives a capacity for the industry to fight back if it is being too abhorrent to them why is this important because the debate hinges on who provides a better balance of power not who provides a power for one or the other when we recognize that there could be trade-offs and important differences there this is a balance because these groups have disproportionately less power in the status quo because they're a minority of the population even if it's a big industry unionization has substantially fallen since neoliberalism and clearly they have substantially less money for lobbying in big financial groups what is this more balanced approach to do that is critical one it leads to a method of communication and dialogue between the industry to address grievances and have them be listened to as opposed to have it having them entirely shut out and not being able to participate in the voting process because they just don't have enough numbers before getting into more of the impacts i'd like to take ceo if they have a py so as you can see there will probably be conversations about what exactly you will and won't let through so obviously this is not a balance it is a disproportionate effect that is likely to be weaponized against everyone the reason why it's a balance and it can't be a conversation on your side because the conversation only matters when the person has a reasonable voice that you need to listen to when the industry is one that doesn't have much power there's no reason to consult them because they have no check back against you there's no way to get you or compel you to listen now they have a mechanism because they can veto that process but it doesn't give them too much because they don't make the policy the industry doesn't direct have direct control over the policy of the industry it doesn't get to choose the person themselves that's why it's a balance they get to participate in that process they don't get to control the actual thing the second impact of this balance is that this leads to less antagonism between the state and the industry it's less likely that you have wildcat strikes that come out of nowhere because someone that's now acts as a bridge between the state and the industry and an actor critically that represents both interests that's the key to our case that you need someone in there who doesn't just represent the interests of the majority and everybody in the state but recognizes the impacts of someone that asymmetrically suffers from that and thirdly it leads to critically better time horizons of policies that are more aligned and optimized because there's essentially more information shared because both actors feel comfortable enough to share those with with the person in charge because that's some degree of connection to them and there's a credible commitment they will care about at least both of their interests to some degree voters have substantially more information now policy discussions happen way more at the point in which the pm chooses a person never been prouder to propose this motion it's about striking a balance i thank the dpm for that speech and call the dlo here hi um am i audible audio is great perfect one second i'm ready to go a huge part of opening government's case relies on one sentence and one particular assertions which is that currently in the status quo these corporations are able to essentially have huge lobbying power on both sides of the house to promote certain politicians so they need that v2 power in order to balance the scale and not have two pro business uh two pro business minister on their side of the house but i want to ask you the following questions what are the structural reasons for this to be the truth because i will give you five reasons as to why currently in the status quo it is actually easier for corporations in industries to lobbied their own labor unions and organizations compared to actually lobby governments who have much larger uh interest groups that they need to adhere to here is a couple of those reasons but what i before that i need you to understand that if i'm able to prove to you that they are going to have a huge ability to actually uh influence the decisions and the vetoes that these labor unions apply to certain positions it actually gives them more power on our side on their side of the house to do bad things and to pick and choose particular people who promote business stuff compared to other policies which are good for multiple industries but are also generally good for multiple people living in society what are the reasons for this compared to their assertion reason number one direct communication channels between the industry and the corporation and the people in there it is very easy to have like particular calls to have particular internal promotions to generally talk with influential people in these places you know them they work for you you uh you know what they care about you know what they talk about all these particular things so to that extent it's very easy to create an internal narrative look guys right now the company is let's say pushing for more wages but the labor union does not want to give you more wages because they care about let's say our pollution policy or more environmental regulation or these particular things it's the same in the education industry uh they can tell their teachers uh like uh tell the teachers oh my gosh uh we want to push for more wages for review but they want to reform the educational system in terms of other particular such as for example giving more for the funding in general for under privileged schools compared to increasing more the wages to actual people now why are these things important because when you create these internal narratives you now put people in a position where the workers themselves lobbied their own labor unions to push for these particular things that directly benefit them compared to other underprivileged groups in society or society in general which means that when they do these particular things they will be to people who actually want to stop uh pollution policies but environmental policies that let's say uh only harm particular vulnerable regions in the country where there's more disease people don't get access to health care they get cancer they get all this particular stuff uh in the same in the context of school it is literally under privileged schools in particular areas that need that extra funding compared to let's say general increase for teachers all over the particular uh the particular country i think that uh on the comparative it is much easier for people to actually lobby their own government for these particular policies but let's give a couple of more reasons the internal structure within these particular companies you have internal divisions you have managers you have people who believe they will get more money if there is a bonus payment system compared to other particular systems so there is already an internal division that you can take advantage of and actually uh uh like lobby disproportionate groups that have bigger voices so like uh like convince the manager they will continue go up in the hurricane they'll get a big bonus if they convince their people that are working under them to actually uh push the labor union for this particular policy it is uh uh uh uh they're also able to corrupt such uh individuals in these particular particular places this all of this analysis destroys a bunch of the uh government case in terms of what are the actual policies that we get in the first in the first place and it's very easy for cooperation to create the deceptive narrative that they're actually working for your interests and vit politicians who in fact implement a much important policies for particular groups that are important in society but also in general policies such as for example increasing the minimum wage such as such as for example taking place in uh like huge environmental um uh environmental policies this this means that huge impacts of owner of people are actually impacted before i continue to take cg go nothing from cg og your case only applies in the narrow subset of instances in which corporations have a massive control over unions if they're so powerful they likely have a similar mechanism of control over the state which means they can exercise the same degree of power over lobbying our case applies in all contexts and rectifies imbalances you do not provide reasons for any of these things i have already provided reasons that there is asymmetric power towards this in terms of lobbying the government you also need to spend a bunch of more money but you also don't have the particular information and governments need to think about multiple different policies that they implement and they can easily be called out in parliament by opposition parties they can easily be called out in protest on the streets because let's say a vulnerable group is literally suffering and dying in a particular area because a pollution policy has not been implemented or you allow this factory to buy up this property next to the river and push all of its uh uh uh pollution into that particular river so there is disproportionate impact and it's very hard to completely lobby a particular government especi especially if that government knows that at the end of the day they need they need to get re-elected they need general support from the populace all these things are much more uh uh uh happening on our side of uh this debate and i think that's in in terms of like these particular ministers they they have huge power to to do a lot of these particular things because they can they like uh can imply certain small subsets of policies that change uh small things that are very beneficial in terms of the range of a wider build that is let's say in general for the industry they can do executive orders they can do uh like disproportionately effect the budgeting towards different counties different countries and things like that so what we have proven you in this debate is that now actually corporations are much stronger on the other side of the house and the ability to have a huge impact on to vulnerable people is much larger i have never been prouder to oppose thank the dlo for that speech and call the member of golf here here yep audible okay i'll be starting my speech in three two one opening opposition suggests that the lobbying power the increased lobbying power as a consequence of this promotion it's going to lead to policies which are societally disutile if you're able to show the opposite we're going to win over top half because opening government says these policies are stable but they did not answer opening opposition's question as to why these policies are not going to be harmful outside the interest of that specific sector i'm going to outline a couple of incentives and integrate my rebuttal what are the incentives for this lobbying to be done well and for the policy to be economically efficient across the board not just for an individual sector first of all there is an incentive for unions and the representatives to survey public preferences insofar as the public themselves are the ones who appoint the political elite this means that they could have an unfavorable regulatory framework in the future which is to say there is a potential crackdown on unions if we have fertile ground for anti-union thought and anti-union politics which is to say if the public already feels that the union is working against them this means that you're creating fertile ground for narratives about unions being perverse organizations that manipulate people but never get anything done to the workers particularly in capitalist countries where we already have on one side a demonization of socialism the idea that unions are reducing economic efficiency and leeching over people's money but secondly the glorification of the capitalist narrative which is to say the meritocratic narrative which supposes that you get the amount of money that you deserve as opposed to the amount of money low before you by some kind of state organization or some kind of union especially because there are historical moments where this has happened after 30 or 40 years of unions being strong got margaret thatcher because one old reagan unions know this has happened historically they want to catch against this which is to say if it's too the loud as well because most people who vote for environment are left-wing and young who are also the voter base is going to vote for pro-union policy and pro-social democratic policy as opposed to pro-business secondly they have the incentive to craft economically viable policies which is to say to hire experts to create policy drafts to produce some kind of economic projections before they present their policy before they lobby why is this the case because in that case they can sell their policy to politicians to co-opt it's easier to get the candidate to say i'm going to take this policy is going to be my platform if he can sell his policies economically viable this is also true because companies are already trying to slam their unions being inefficient so they have an incentive to ensure that they cannot be beaten by statistics that companies cannot go out and say gdp people go down by this amount of percent if you accept this policy which is to say that they have an incentive to create policy which can create economic efficiency across the board which is to say have proven that it's both in accordance with preferences which is all principle i've also proven why it's going to be good policy as opposed to just stable policy i think it's actually incentive to the contrary i think unions can be a vector for crafting good policy why first of all because they have information on the ground that allows them to detect problems within companies that create inefficiencies know that the incentive of unions congrues with economic efficiencies of particular sectors insofar as they want job security down the line they want the company to expand not to contract they want to get raises and promotions which means that the marginal profit of the company has to rise overall so in crafting policy they have to make the company more efficient and a lot of these things are just incredibly intuitive which to say increasing break time increases productivity giving people more benefits makes them happier they work better human resource departments do yes the shift is happening currently in companies like google but it's happening incredibly slowly we want to increase that vector now this is also a mechanism as to why nikolai's speech doesn't really make sense because insofar as workers have visceral knowledge of the problems that they face i don't think they can be misled by the industry experts or whatever but secondly workers are tend to be skeptical towards their bosses because they very often see them as exploitative and not giving them their money and you just have an incentive to encourage this kept skepticism insofar as that encourages urine activity i don't think the people can be misled that easily but also if they can there's no comparative to the opening opposition case because the industry can just mislead them to propaganda campaigns but it can be misled by the government i'm not sure why that's comparative but secondly notice a lot of the policies that you want to slander is economically efficient particularly dlo i know he's very pro-business are actually good for economic efficiency because raising minimum wages raising benefits providing people with healthcare increases the disposable income people have it creates aggregate demand and never get spending we're circulating the economy taxable transactions which are funneled to the state to provide public services but also within the economy within the local grocery store within the local fruit shop and this is the largest delta we have to unlock in terms of spending because poor people have the least amount of disposable income most of their little amount of money goes to things like health care and safety and stuff like this at the point where we unlock this income we unlock a significant amount of spending that did not exist before it increases economic efficiency it can however only be done through this motion because in a status quo unions can only lobby companies can out to lobby them the comparative now these units can directly impact the regulatory environment that these companies are going to work in they have retaliatory power but the companies cannot stop because they have an effective veto which is to say the only way we can unlock the unions and actors of good policy is by providing this motion i've both linked the impact to the emotion but they've also given you explicit analysis why the policy is going to be actively good the response we get from all are corruption and privilege first of all unions tend to be structured democratically which is to say i don't care if the people at the top are rich and religious if most people are secular they will vote sacred because unions have democratic structures and muslims are not owned by the state naomi secondly however corruption is just a mitigatory mechanism which is the same so far as all seems to stand for democracy which is also impacted by corruption i'm not sure why corruption is a reason to abandon a policy it's mitigation mitigation at best but lastly even if people do vote religious in a particular union this is in congruence with open opposition's own principle if that's the preference that people vote for fine they need to stand behind us the reason why we weigh over og is because og uh conveniently mitigates their own principle when ahmed tries to preempt by red herring he says property is acquired justly this means he also justifies the imbalance of power created as a consequence so their principle is inconsistent my practical is true regardless i have another extension by before i think opening up a position seeing policies are economically viable doesn't mean that they won't be self-interested in the most optimal policy for all such as teachers pushing for higher pay relative to other public servants or industrial unions pushing for anti-environmental policies knockout effects don't work because you're more affected by losing your job than the future of climate change i've given you incentives why they're also going to care about negative externalities but i also think that if i can show that this self-interest congruent economic efficiency i don't care itself interested i mean it's nice to be altruistic i'm not sure i care about that second extension we simply get the more union membership note that currently unit membership is steadily declining mostly to slander campaigns by companies that mostly go along the lines of look this is incredibly inefficient the benefit of being in a union for four years is about three hundred dollars per year walmart said to their workers for this money you could have just bought an xbox why are you within a union they will not get things done they will manipulate you this is combined with aggressive policies of companies towards workers who try to unionize internal memos that push executives to portray certain workers unintelligent or stupid because they push other students they literally organize seminars on why unions are bad this now shifts the calculus because unions literally have a mechanism by which they can affect laws this is literally the case because they can say we veto this candidate with that particular policy they can no longer be seen as inefficient which means you and i also have the ability to retaliate companies will be less aggressive towards workers because now unions can veto their pro-business candidate this shifts the calculus and more people join unions that's not as good because of lobbying but auxiliary benefits even if you don't lobby successfully unions pay for your healthcare if it's not provided they give you sick pay if it don't provide it they give you job training they give you health and safety equipment if your job doesn't give it to you or the equipment is not provided to you they grant you huge amounts of benefits especially for lower middle class people even if they don't help me successfully so i'm not contingent on either successful or good lobbying this is the most comparative case in the debate for all of those reasons closing government very clearly takes the round attack the member of gov and call the member of up here hey i presume i can be heard yes you can cheers all right i'll start my speech in three two one two contributions from closing opposition first we're gonna explain why this is bad for the power of unions which is both the largest time in the debate and deletes the government ventures benefit in this debate because if the union in this sector does not exist they cannot exercise a veto and second i'm going to explain why it is that the exercise of this veto would be in fact very bad much better than opening opposition let's start with why this is bad for the power of unions the first thing to explain here is that you now have more of an incentive to do things like union bus that looks like anti-union laws that looks like funding campaigns to convince people not to join them that looks like funding law sets against unions in some parts of the world that looks like literally killing union leaders and now you have to completely eliminate the presence of a union in this sector or make sure that one can never get off the ground in order to make sure they never exercise a veto so if you're a country that has a nascent uh teachers union then you are clearly going to do as much as you possibly can to avoid that union ever coming to fruition such that they cannot exercise a veto first of all because you want to have control of your ministers and second because at the point where a union pops up in this particular sector that union is now uh is now able to bring your government to a standstill not allow you to be able to appoint to appoint ministers that means you are never going to allow the union to exist in the first place or you are going to bust that union and what that means is that you will not get unions in the first instance this has two impacts first it deletes government ventures benefit because if the government never allows an education union to exist in this sector in the first instance no one can exercise a veto but second it means you no longer get all of the other good benefits that we could claim on our side of unions things like better conditions things like better pay closing government says ah unions will always act in good ways so that they don't get union busted first obviously acting in bad ways leading to union busting is something that can exist on either side and if this claim is just completely a historic throughout history unions have attempted to enrich themselves as much as they possibly can all right that is for a couple of reasons it's first because they have particularly short-term incentives right so the particular union leader at the time wants to make sure that their members at the time have democratically elected them can get as much money as possible so they don't necessarily care that much about the future but secondly there's a collective action problem here because a single union going too far or trying to get too much power for themselves isn't going to be the tipping point to cause all this anti-union busting but at the point where the but at the point where all of the unions do it then that's where you're likely to get much more clamp down on unions and what that means is that uh and what that means is that you all the unions have the incentives themselves to go as hard as possible because they're not going to make a huge difference the end of this argument the unions never pop up in the first instance in the countries that most need them and because i've just had a crack at you if closing government wants to wants to poi uh yeah if regulation affects specific sectors in a lot of instances then your mechanism there just doesn't actually land think about how this happens in the real world sydney wait why doesn't it land explain your poi uh if you have regulation that can happen towards a specific sector then you don't have the collective action problem mechanizing as you said which means an individual industry won't go as far as they have to i'll explain in the worst speech okay so basically the problem with this is that it runs into the first so obviously there's like multiple characterizations but i deal with that characterization in the first one where i explain that you will then attack this particular industry or never allow it to that industry develops in this first instance second reason it's bad for unions is because now unions have an incentive to keep people out under the status quo you want to grow because even though your share of power in that union goes down when you grow the overall power of the union increases and that means that your power increases however this form of power is a form of power that isn't contingent on the size of the union and in fact when the union gets larger your your amount of control over that union is your control over that union power in fact goes down and no this is the largest power you have because in many parts of the world other forms of union power are systemically in decline because we've seen things like anti-union laws this now means that the largest power the union has isn't contingent on the union growing and in fact everyone in that union has an incentive to make sure that as few people join that union as possible so they can have as much control over that power in the first instance noting this also means you want your particular faction to control that union noting that unions are deeply political and deeply factionalized therefore you actually have an incentive to keep your union smaller so that your faction is able to exercise this veto power and that looks like things like the way that they keep people out is doing things like setting higher jews having more dem are having more bureaucratic barriers to entry uh denying people's applications into union not actively recruiting individuals and this means that the union is now likely to be smaller because the people in the union don't have an incentive to grow when the key power of the union actually their power over it dilutes at the point where more people join it the impact of this is twofold first it means that less people get access to how unions work less protection for their workers rights and less high wages secondly it also kills government benches benefit because it means it's not everyone in that industry voting but the particularly most powerful faction in that union that was able to capture it right that you the government bench might say well no you have other incentives to be larger i explain why this is the most significant power that a union has which means it's the largest incentive and therefore you're uh and therefore you're going to preference your amount of control over that or over all other interests and therefore you're not going to let people into your union cg says more people will join the union because they have an incentive clearly if the people in the union don't want you to join they won't at that point we prove that unions are left to get nuked by this deletes their benefit is the largest impact in the debate clear co1 but let's now explain why it is that you that you are actually if it is used this would actually be catastrophic much better than o.o the first thing is we just think in a lot of instances you are not going to be able to get agreement between the government uh and the union and that means that you will not have an education minister right you will not have a minister for this particular industry that is first because many times particularly when there are conservative governments labor unions view these people as literally the enemy they will never agree with them and second note that labor unions often very politically embedded they have things like a labour party that directly supports them or at least a political party with which the unions are aligned for instance the democratic party in the united states and that means that where there is a conservative party they are likely to deliberately nuke their ability to like appoint ministers of any kind in order to benefit the political party that they support which is the biggest time to them using it because it means you get gridlock it means that governments literally cannot have ministers to be able to function that is incredibly important finally i'm going to explain why unions have sets of bad incentives because oo says oh there might be under regulation we're going to explain what they actually do first they can your public services this looks like non-functional hospitals continuing to run because the unions will not allow individuals to be laid off it looks like education unions that refuse to have any forms of reform and that is incredibly bad because it means that all of society is harmed by the fact that like public services come to a standstill second it means they can often do things like create monopolies over labor higher so in many instances like for instance the australian maritime union used to not allow you to contract out to particular companies they used to say you have to come to work for the union and then we will labor hire you out and that meant first of all that prices go up and secondly people couldn't get jobs because the union was artificially constraining supply in order to keep the prices high and third note the connection between unions and organized crime and the way in which unions have often been used as a front front for criminality they can now stop any kind of attacks on these bad things that they're doing first because they are able to veto any minister responsible for them who would regulate it and secondly insofar as the union now has this ability to the government the government will not come after the unions this is a much better explanation than opening opposition of the actual explicit things that unions are going to do that are bad i think the member of op and quality got flipped here here this game won't give me nice i have a lot of stuff now for a variety of reasons the comparative in this debate is quite small i'm just going to name the ones that were said in this debate firstly the fact that we explained to you in closing government uniquely the degree to which unions care about public opinion because regulation can directly affect them and they don't want to swing that from happening negatively secondly the race the media that open government outlines thirdly owes idea on industrial culture fourthly the extent which regulation still exists or say that it needs to be enforced but of course the risk reward calculus for an industry skirting regulations and potentially losing their license and the business is massive so this mechanism doesn't land simply the fact that you're still choosing from a subset of politicians that are being provided to you by the conservative party of co wants to talk about them and secondly the fact that it's congruent with economic interest which is to say that the industries themselves and the workers within it both want positive economic impacts and to the degree that the industries are being are lobbying higher than individual people are in terms of voting therefore those lobbying powers are going to be used and that's the kind of thing that happens therefore there's only three comparatives in this debate firstly where there's uh on union membership secondly on slight disalignments of preferences and thirdly on the principle so firstly with regards to union like union membership let's deal with ceo's case here the first thing they say is that you have a higher incentive for union busting now that they have this degree of power firstly i continue this is a knife to their opening opposition's characterization it says that you can use them as a ventriloquist for your own interest secondly i would say to you that it becomes less effective now because insofar as you can say to people oh you shouldn't join a union you have a decreased capacity to do that well you can't use the techniques that we outlined here in closing government are saying it would not be worth your time and indeed the fact that unions are capable of explaining to you why it's economically beneficial for you as an individual and indeed aligns with public perception as we explain it to you in our extension i got no response in closing opposition but secondly i would contend that there is no increased incentive to the degree that unions are able to do things like union busting which is to say i think under the status quo is co are right in the third power or in the second part of their extension about the things that unions can do to an industry then the industry would already have maybe the maximal incentive and so the comparative is on capacity and indeed on the comparative capacity we explained to you that now that even nascent unions even small unions have massive retaliatory power against an industry that wants to undermine it and see ceo's own example that they're willing to do things like hospitals within their own characterization being shut down they're willing to take retaliatory efforts against their own thing means that unibus becomes less effective second thing they say is aha a single union would go really hard because of collective action problem again i poi this and they never gave a response to it apart from flagging the first part that i just responded to so on face they've lost that comparative and the explanation that i provided to you is the fact that if you are one individual industry say for example the teachers union because if you lobby for things that are massively beneficial for just teachers and not the public that will be negative because you can get directly regulated as a consequence of that ceo's case is only true regulation has to be universal but you can have industry specific regulation and therefore that case doesn't land the third thing they say is you want when you want to get a higher degree of control you want less people within your union because you want to maintain your positional power this only makes sense if you as one individual person within the in industry are more powerful there's three and four members we would contend to you that hierarchy still exist which is to say if you are the the upper level of a union right now when new people come in you maintain your place in a hot place in the hierarchy secondly you undermine your ability if you want fewer members to do the other good things that unions are able to do as we explain it to an extension things like lobbying but also all all the other corollary impacts that explain to you your power decreases on net and thirdly because you join your trade union for a reason and this is the thing if you create a trade union or join a trade union in face of all the harms that ceo outlined in terms of union busting it flags as an explicit preference that a person wants the betterment of the people within that industry and therefore this case learned like to be comparative we're winning on this comparative that's probably the most important one in the debate because if the change in regulation is quite speculative if we're able to provide you a massive degree to which people are able to access the benefits of unions healthcare worker pay safety regulations gloves masks etc that increases the quality of life for individuals within the industry on but also doesn't have the negative externalities that are worth talking about second comparative then in the database is on the disalignment of preferences and so far as when they exist opening government on this are remarkably uh like are not not very strong the reason for this is they firstly outline knowledge but without explaining why the industry doesn't have the capacity to have that knowledge with regards to the lobbying that they say is the most powerful thing that happens within that context and secondly they talk about the ability to undermine lobbying without ever characterizing to you the degree to which that disalignment of preference is happening makes them weak to owe's response that indeed the kinds of things that the industry will lobby for will be negative where do we fall into this in terms of explanation of the kinds of things that change this is the comparative we explained to you why in a much stronger way than opening government unions have a massive incentive to align with public preferences because they fear regulation and also contend as a further response to opening opposition that these are the people who are most likely to have the direct experience of harms towards them in their life they understand what it looks like when an economy downturns they understand the harms of environmental regulations not being there when it means that they can't clean their clothes in the river anymore because these are the pores within society that was proximately affected by negative externalities outside of their places as a worker and their friends and families are too i would contend that these people are in a better position to make that decision on the basis of preferences although i'll explain that later when i deal with the principle therefore the slightest alignment of preferences is where we explain to you an extension we expect you something very simple which is the kind of visceral experiences that workers have of working on the ground something that does not trickle up the corporate ladder i know for example working in my job that if there was a ground mat on the floor rather than just a hard floor that was there i'd be able to walk quicker later in the day because my legs wouldn't be broken and tired but the companies because they're based off of this idea of having an oppositionality between workers and their bosses and think that the workers are just looking for more and more things like more money for themselves for greedy reasons means that the way in which they think that you get more economically efficient is by being punitive this is the reason why very few industries apart from the tech sector have actually updated to be more ergonomic towards their workers despite the fact that we now have the economic information to provide to us to explain that that might in a lot of instances be beneficial towards the economy the economy being good of course and in terms of general wing it's just good in general in so far as it means you have things like increased tax revenue for the people increased wages in people's pockets increased pay overall her point wasn't that a lot of teachers being religious is bad but that there are asymmetries of who becomes an industry leader versus a general demographic of the industry based on privilege leading to things like pushing for more seniority pay and just like religious funding from external donors distorting priorities also the debates are only about unions you can't give like four people debating um the problem though is you never explain to us why this privilege actually transfers in a meaningful way as opposed to the way it does within general society when you can get economic privilege for the reason of my response to closing opposition which you chose not to respond to in that poi people with the most amount of drive within these trade unions tend to be the ones that rise to the top people that can be most persuasive to the people within the union senate those ones that will rise to the top people have the most degree of you know just like like drive for change those like people's rights that's how in terms of the principle i think we're able to win that over all by reducing it to the patriot clash because not the harms in the principle are practically contingent because based off of the idea of coercion and undermining version of the state we were proposed to you like that things like not having proper health and safety regulations not having enough money in your pocket are also courses but notably also od's principle self-defeating and we explain why you're aligned with preferences within opening opposition therefore on the way up in terms of this debate closing government has to win because on all strands of the of the debate relative to the burdens of proof of those strands we're able to provide a winning comparison to you on the proposition inside the house and then conclusively within the debate propose i think they got flip and call the final speaker opposition whip here hey i'll just clarify that i can be heard yep audio is great all right uh that's good uh in the meantime i'm just gonna sort of spread and organize my papers and get a timer up so let's give me 15 seconds please okay all right i'm just going to get my timer up start this speech starting a speech in three two one closing opposition provides three important contributions to this debate the first contribution that we provide is to explain why unions are just unlikely to be able to exist and function and that argument necessarily occurs upstream of anything that opening government or closing government wish to say because both of them attempt to provide a series of reasons of either why this veto power would be used well by union's art to help workers which is the opening government case and then the closing government case is why this power would be used well to help people at large if we prove this first argument we necessarily beat those two teams and opening opposition by making an argument that actually defeats the government bench assuming their characterization about unions is still true the second important contribution that we provide however is just explaining why unions get incredibly elitist and i would weigh this perhaps the most highly in the debate for the reason that there are a series of individuals who often need unions to get important representation they need things like workers rights which that cg whip does a bit of impacting we explain why you're less likely to get that but finally we provide a contribution that actually explains how unions have the capacity to implement bad you know sorts of legislation and policy and do bad things at this veto as opposed to opening opposition who just say they will so let's start with closing government they give us maybe two responses to our extension sorry three the first is calling it a knife which it obviously isn't as i explained in my introduction we just make an argument that occurs upstream of opening opposition we do not contradict them directly no analysis there the second response that is given is to say that well your collective action problem doesn't work because you will target specific industries and industries as a whole won't be regulated the first thing i want to note about this is that it is mitigation because there are still industries that are incredibly important that are likely to be cracked down on so there's a harm that they still necessarily have to bite in the trade-off but secondly as they explain obviously a set of corporations and businesses and policy makers have incentive to label these individuals as bad for the reasons that not only that the government banks agree on but that they empirically do in the status quo so obviously if these incentives still apply then at the point at which one union starts doing bad things you want to paint a board brush stroke of all unions doing bad things so you can equally all deregulate and over those unions so to the extent that this only occurs in one instance they never show why that wouldn't be used to jeopardize and screw over all unions in general the third response we get is on our sort of membership part of the extension they say well you're unlikely to for example become elitist or kick people out to maintain power because there's already a pre-established hierarchy but obviously this is untrue for the reason that unions are democratically elected right like new members that have different interests to you for the reason that they occupy different socio-economic positions for example or the younger or in their different parts of their careers obviously they present a threat to you as someone who is more established when they have for example a bigger voting bloc but also i would argue that this veto specifically creates this incentive because now being elected comes with so much more direct ability to privilege yourself that now even if this incentive didn't currently exist it definitely exists on their side of the house that means our extension stance and for the reasons i outline in my introduction it wins the debate let's talk about closing government they really have one extension because their second extinction about getting more people is reliant upon unions doing good things in the first place and is entirely contingent and basically just impacting their one extension in this debate is unions will do good things opening government not taking you uh unions will do good things and they give a series of general reasons why it might be nice for unions to do good things they say maybe it will remove a few narratives no i already respond to why this isn't going to happen they say well maybe you'll capture some voter bases and the real reason that they whip over and over again is well unions are made up of members who are affected by economic outcomes therefore you want to get good economic outcomes for your members but there are obviously four problems with this extension then what i'll do now is outline those and explain why this will not be the actual incentive that disproportionately affects people within unions to operate this way the first thing that i will explain is that you can already vote for things like the government to represent your economic interests the reason that you specifically join a union is because you want specific work interest advocated for the point at which you know unions are no longer doing this and they're considering general sets of for example economic outcomes at the point at which you just go well why am i even here paying subscription fees no things like subscription things do make this a necessary opportunity cost that a lot of individuals for example particularly poorer individuals have to engage in but the second thing i'll say is that you're often motivated by incredibly short-term incentives right because if your country is experiencing recession or if your job is specifically going to be laid off then obviously you don't care about what other people in the country you know want for example you care about your job you care about putting food on your plate and that is the reason why not only in general but in specific circumstances where it matters most obviously these unions are going to care about their own incentives as opposed to general people for those reasons it's that cg never proves why this is the most likely incentive that people will operate on now that i'm done with them cg go apart from no mechanism as to why unions would lobby generally know specifically up bench has yet to provide a reason as to why states and companies would not already be at maximum incentive to scrub our unions given their own explanations of why unions are bad therefore the comparative is on capacity of unions to retaliate that's where we get more membership yeah so the basic claim being made in this poi is that well you're already screwing over unions to the most extent so therefore there's no change i would just say that this is empirically untrue for the reason that unions often do have a lot of collecting bargaining power people do listen to them but all that previous speech actually explains like why sorry in my speech why narrative gets worse but there's a greater capacity for things like to screw over but now i'm also going to explain why policy gets worked with also occurs upstream of this rebuttal so let's talk about within government they have two arguments first it is principally legitimate i'm just gonna say let's assume this is true this is not a reason why we should do something it's not positive material it just says that it's legitimate so i don't care about this let's move on to their second argument which is that it will create a balance their only mech for this is like you will have conversations with people and i play this and i explain that now obviously companies and people proposing policy come to you in the first place because now they cater their policies specifically to you to for example not get over you don't want to for example avoid being vetoed in the senate and have time to grace you don't want to have administrative delays there probably is outside pressure to get your policies through so that means if opening government are like it creates a balance obviously it creates a balance in a really bad way that disproportionately favor these unions they're like well no you're not actually setting the policy but you might as well be but even if that's not true obviously people naturally tend towards uh these sorts of things as i already explained their only other claim then is that well sometimes governments have majority and they can elect anyone uh our extension explains specifically why you're unlikely to for example like you're likely to elect the worst sorts of people because you kick everyone else out of the union now briefly on opening opposition oh sorry like the takeaway from opening government is just they have to prove why this balance is good or fair you're just giving some more power which is bad uh opening opposition we beat them in three ways first of all we operate they operate the assumption that unions are probably still good in a lot of instances we explain why those unions disappear secondly we show you why unions kick everyone else out then that actually unlocks their corruption and policy material because it explains why you can specifically lobby for you know specific interests why you're not bound by things like a series of other voices but finally we mentioned much better explain and unlock their biggest benefit which is how you can specifically have the capacity to do this things like constraining membership preventing people from joining or  over emergency services we win on os metric by actually mechanizing this and we take the debate i thank the opposition whip as well as everyone for an amazing debate uh this marks the end of the preliminary rounds i believe this is a certain realm so you may cross the floor shake hands and we'll have the results after the break all the best thanks everyone that was really fun best of luck for the break you
